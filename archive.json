    "summary": "High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a hole $\\gamma$ pocket, or not. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming fluctuations for the leading $s_\\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge provided the maximum energy level of the $\\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.",

    "summary": "The ghost Gutzwiller ansatz (gGut) embedding technique was shown to achieve comparable accuracy to the gold standard dynamical mean-field theory method in simulating real material properties, yet at a much lower computational cost. Despite that, gGut is limited by the algorithmic bottleneck of computing the density matrix of the underlying effective embedding model, a quantity which must be converged within a self-consistent embedding loop. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical gGut technique which computes the ground state properties of embedding Hamiltonians with the help of a quantum computer, using the sample-based quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) algorithm. We study the applicability of SCI-based methods to the evaluation of the density of states for single-band Anderson impurity models within gGut and find that such ground states of interest become sufficiently sparse in the CI basis as the number of ghost orbitals is increased. Further, we investigate the performance of QSCI using local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) variational quantum states in combination with a circuit cutting technique, prepared on IQM's quantum hardware for system sizes of up to 11 ghost orbitals, equivalent to 24 qubits. We report converged gGut calculations which correctly capture the metal-to-insulator phase transition in the Fermi-Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice by using quantum samples to build an SCI basis with as little as $1\\%$ of the total CI basis states.",

Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally reported nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. To gain insight into the orbital feature of superconductivity, we explore the projection of different pairing bonds on Fermi surface. We find that the nodeless gap at $\\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, in which the latter is triggered by the former through hybridization, and both hold the same sign.",

    "summary": "DFT is vital for materials discovery, and at the base of extensive molecular and materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in chemistry and materials science aims for \"chemical accuracy,\" but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r r2SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r2SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r2SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r2SCANY@r2SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r2SCANY@r2SCANX utilizes different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r2SCANY@r2SCANX enhances the r2SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+U method. The O2 overbinding in r2SCAN (~0.3 eV/O2) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r2SCAN10@r2SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r2SCAN10@r2SCAN50, minimizing r2SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r2SCAN10@r2SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r2SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r2SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r2SCAN10@r2SCAN, which is 10 to 300 times faster than r2SCAN10.",

    "summary": "Free energy calculations are at the heart of physics-based analyses of biochemical processes. They allow us to quantify molecular recognition mechanisms, which determine a wide range of biological phenomena from how cells send and receive signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations require computational models that accurately capture both the varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules. Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target, applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods scale unfavorable with system size, we analyze requirements for quantum computers to provide highly accurate energies that impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with modern classical simulation techniques that incorporate machine learning to model large molecules.",

In order to clarify the structural, spectroscopic and theoretical details of that evolution, here we present ARPES data supplementing morphology and scanning tunneling measurements. These combined experimental results are compared with predictions from a variety of electronic structure approaches, mostly density functional DFT+U, but not neglecting Mott-Hubbard models, both ordered and disordered. These theoretical pictures address different spectroscopic aspects, including the 2D Fermi surface, the Hubbard bands, etc. While no single picture account for all observations at once,the emergent hypothesis compatible with all data is that metallization arises from sub-subsurface boron doping, additional to the main standard subsurface boron geometry, that would leave the surface insulating. These results advance the indispensable frame for the further understanding of this fascinating system.",

Starting from the Luttinger-Ward functional for the grand thermodynamic potential, we derive expressions of the Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity in a form suitable for numerical studies. They are applied to the weakly attractive Hubbard model in three dimensions to calculate the thermodynamic potentials numerically and continuously for the normal, pseudogap, and superconducting phases on the same footing. It is shown that the entry into the pseudogap phase is detectable as singularities of thermodynamic potentials, especially a discontinuity in the heat capacity.",

To clarify the impact of the supercurrent on magnetism and superconductivity near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, we study the two-dimensional Hubbard model based on a fluctuation exchange approximation for a current-carrying superconducting state. We show a supercurrent-induced antiferromagnetism and emergence of spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The former results from Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, suppression in the superconducting gap, and strong correlation effects beyond the mean-field theory.

Using a $4\\pi$ electrocyclization as an example, we show how Green's functions generalize the concepts of symmetry allowed and symmetry forbidden reactions even in the presence of strong multi-reference correlations. We demonstrate how symmetry forbidden reactions are characterized by strong multi-reference correlations, resulting in crossings of Green's function zeros rather than poles as MO-theory would predict. Taking into account Green's functions zeros, a topological invariant is introduced that captures symmetry protected crossings of poles or zeros. We discuss the effects of symmetry breaking and outline generalizations of our approach to reactions without any conserved spatial symmetries along the reaction path. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic application of modern topological methods to chemical reactions and can be generalized to reactions involving different spin states or to excited states.",

    "summary": "Inspired by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, we investigate the role of magnetism emerging from a hypothetical insulating $d^8$ parent state. We demonstrate that due to the interplay of superexchange and Hund's coupling, the system can be in a high-spin, low-spin or spin-gapped state. The low-spin state has singlets across the bilayer in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, with charge carriers in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Thus, at low energy scales, it behaves as an effective one band system when hole doped. By contrast, the high-spin state is a more robust, spin-1 antiferromagnet. Using Hartree-Fock methods, we find that for fixed interaction strength and doping, high-spin magnetism remains more robust than the low-spin counterpart. Whether this implies that the high spin state provides a stronger pairing glue, or more strongly competes with superconductivity remains an open question. Our analysis therefore underscores the importance of identifying the spin state for understanding superconductivity in nickelates.",

Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. Our results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and the nonlocal correlations with its quantum environment.",

At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\\pi}{\\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.",

By analyzing antisymmetrized, temperature-dependent RIXS spectra over a range of in-plane momentum transfers, we observe a clear suppression of low-energy spectral weight below T$_c$, indicative of superconducting gap formation. This suppression is most pronounced at small momentum transfers ($|\\boldsymbol{q}_\\parallel| \\leq 0.18$ r.l.u.) and corresponds to a gap size of approximately 2$\\Delta_0 \\sim$ 130 meV. Comparison with theoretical calculations of the momentum-dependent charge susceptibility supports a d-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap, while an isotropic s-wave gap fails to reproduce key experimental features. These findings establish RIXS as a powerful, bulk-sensitive probe of superconducting gap symmetry and highlight its utility for studying materials beyond the reach of surface-sensitive techniques such as ARPES and STM.",

The nonlinear conductivity, obtained in Green's function formalism, is decomposed into its quantum geometric constituents using a projector-based approach. In addition to the previously identified Berry curvature and interband quantum metric dipoles, we obtain a third term of quantum geometric origin, given by the momentum derivative of the $intraband$ quantum metric. This contribution, which we term the intraband quantum metric dipole, provides substantial corrections to the NLHE in topological magnets and becomes the dominant geometric term in topological antiferromagnets with gapped Dirac cones. Considering generalized 2D and 3D Weyl/Dirac Hamiltonians, describing a large class of topological band crossings with sizable quantum geometry, we derive analytical expressions of the NLHE, thereby revealing the individual contributions of the three quantum geometric terms. Combined with an exhaustive symmetry classification of all magnetic space groups, this analysis leads to the identification of several candidate materials expected to exhibit large intrinsic NLHE, including the antiferromagnets $\\text{Yb}_3\\text{Pt}_4$, $\\text{CuMnAs}$, and $\\text{CoNb}_3\\text{S}_6$, as well as the nodal-plane material $\\text{MnNb}_3\\text{S}_6$. Finally, our projector-based approach yields a compact expression for the NLHE in terms of momentum derivatives of the Bloch Hamiltonian matrix alone, enabling efficient numerical evaluation of each contribution in the aforementioned materials.",

The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.",

It has been extensively studied within the Hubbard model, where a quantum critical transition occurs at a finite temperature second-order critical point. This work investigates the Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model that may be viewed as a three-orbital lattice model including an interacting, localized orbital coupled to a delocalized conduction orbital via a second conduction orbital. This model could also be viewed as a bilayer model involving a conventional periodic Anderson model layer coupled to a metallic layer. Within the dynamical mean field theory, this model possesses a strictly zero temperature quantum critical point separating a Fermi liquid and a Mott insulating phase. By employing a simplified version of the dynamical mean field theory, namely, the two-site or linearized dynamical mean field theory, we provide an analytical estimate of the critical parameter strengths at which the transition occurs at zero temperature. We also provide an analytical estimate of the single-site von Neumann entanglement entropy. This measure can be used as a robust identifier for the phase transition. We extend these calculations to their cluster version to incorporate short-range, non-local spatial correlations and discuss their effects on the transition observed in this model.",

Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.",

    "summary": "Weak first-order pseudocriticality with approximate scale invariance has been observed in a variety of settings, including the intriguing case of deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. Recently, this has been interpreted as extremely slow flows (\"walking behavior\") for real-valued couplings in proximity to a bona fide critical point with complex-valued couplings, described by a complex conformal field theory (CFT). Here we study an SU($N$) generalization of the the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is a familiar model for deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in 1+1 dimensions the model is located near a complex CFT, whose proximity can be tuned as a function of $N$. We employ state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations for continuous $N$ along with an improved loop estimator for the R\\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy based on a nonequilibrium work protocol. These techniques allow us to track the central charge of this model in detail as a function of $N$, where we observe excellent agreement with CFT predictions. Notably, this includes the region $N>2$, where the CFT moves into the complex plane and pseudocritical drifts enable us to recover the real part of the complex central charge with remarkable accuracy. Since the present model with $N=3$ is also equivalent to the spin-1 biquadratic model, our work sheds new light on the dimerized phase of the spin-1 chain, demonstrating that it is pseudocritical and proximate to a complex CFT.",

The charge carriers occupy the wide bands of $x^2-y^2$ symmetry, and their Cooper pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$ band filling increases, i.e. moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation.

Recent research indicates that these orders can intertwine, with the superconducting order parameter coupling to modulations in the electronic density. To elucidate this interplay, we study a two-dimensional XY model with a periodic modulation of the coupling strength in one spatial direction. Using a combination of tensor network methods and Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal a non-monotonic, dome-like dependence of $T_c$ on the modulation wavelength, with the peak $T_c$ shifting to longer wavelengths as the modulation strength grows. The origin of this phenomenon is traced back to an effective pinning of vortices in the valleys of the modulation, confirmed by a comparison to modulated $q$-state clock models. These findings shed new light on the phase behavior of intertwined superconducting and charge-ordered states, offering a deeper understanding of their complex interactions.",

Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.",

In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \\sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.",

Using perturbative Green's function methods, we examine an $s$-$d$ model on a geometrically frustrated lattice with noncollinear spin texture that breaks time-reversal and parity symmetries, leading to spin-triplet pairing correlations. The effective Josephson tunneling in the presence of such an exchange field leads to an anisotropic Josephson coupling between $d$-vectors, which prefers a spatially inhomogeneous pairing order. Furthermore, we discuss anomalous vortices arising from the spatially inhomogeneous $d$-vector in the absence of a magnetic field for nonunitary triplet pairing order. We also propose a Josephson diode effect in which the diode efficiency is proportional to the spin chirality of the local exchange field. Our results can help understand the experiments in superconducting proximitized Mn$_3$Ge and in 4Hb-TaS$_2$.",

This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition.

    "summary": "Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\\text{K}_2\\text{Co}(\\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.",

In the limit of strong interactions we reproduce the antiferromagnetic 3-sublattice ordered state previously identified in the SU(3) Heisenberg model. At intermediate interaction strength we find antiferromagnetic states exhibiting zigzag patterns of different lengths, in agreement with previous Hartree-Fock and constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We study the color order parameter and energy anisotropy, which are discontinuous across the phase transitions. Finally, we analyze the different energy contributions in two competing phases, identifying low-energy bonds at the corners of the zigzag that help stabilize the zigzag states.",

    "summary": "The optical spectra of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are dominated by tightly bound excitons and trions. In the low doping limit, trions are often described as three-body quasiparticles consisting of two electrons and one hole or vice versa. However, trions are more rigorously understood as quasiparticles arising from the interaction between an exciton and excitation of the Fermi sea - referred to as exciton Fermi polaron. Here we employ pump-probe spectroscopy to directly observe the formation of exciton Fermi polarons in a model system composed of a WSe2 monolayer adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). Following the pump-injection of Rydberg excitons in WSe2, a time-delayed probe pulse tracks the development of Rydberg exciton Fermi polarons as interactions with localized carriers in the tBLG moire superlattice evolve. Both the exciton Fermi polaron relaxation rate and binding energy are found to increase with electron or hole density. Our findings provide insight into the optical response of fundamental excitations in 2D Van der Waals systems and reveal how many-body interactions give rise to emergent quasiparticles.",

Using a valence bond solid ansatz corroborated by density matrix renormalization group simulations, we investigate the nature of magnon and spinon excitations through the single-mode approximation. We show that the magnon develops an incommensurate dispersion at $J_2 \\approx 0.32J_1$, while the spinons, viewed as domain walls between degenerate valence bond solid states, become incommensurate at $J_2 \\approx 0.4J_1$ beyond the Lifshitz point ($J_2 \\approx 0.388J_1$). The dynamical structure factor exhibits rich spectral features shaped by the interplay between these excitations, with magnons appearing as resonances embedded in the spinon continuum. The spinon gap shows a nonmonotonic behavior, reaching a peak near the center of the partially dimerized phase and closing at the boundaries, suggesting the appearance of a floating phase as a result of the condensation of incommensurate spinons. Comparative analysis with the spin-$5/2$ case confirms the universality of these phenomena across half-integer higher-spin systems. Our results provide detailed insight into how fractionalization and incommensurate condensation govern the spectral properties of frustrated spin chains, offering a unified picture across different spin magnitudes.",

We find that the introduction of hydrogen at the apical oxygen vacancy position strongly influences the Wannier function corresponding to the effective interstitial orbital at the Ni site bound to the hydrogen. This results in the near disappearance of the electron pocket at the $k_z$ = $\\pi$ Fermi surface, keeping that of $k_z$ = 0 unchanged, compared to the dehydrogenated case. The two-band model thus remains valid even in the presence of H. The calculated superconducting order parameters both in absence and presence of H, show a two-hump superconductivity arising the two overlapping domes, one arising from $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and another arising from interstitial orbital degree of freedom. Hydrogenation strengthens the latter, marginally affecting the former.",

    "summary": "The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\\lesssim 2\\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.",

We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.",

Specifically, we study the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Kagome lattice, a geometrically frustrated structure that gives rise to a highly degenerate energy spectrum. To successfully simulate this system, we employ a qubit reduction strategy leveraging the Contextual Subspace methodology, significantly reducing the problem size prior to execution on the quantum device. We improve the quality of these subspaces by using the wavefunctions obtained from low bond dimension Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations to bias the subspace stabilizers through a symplectic approximate symmetry generator extraction algorithm. Reducing the Hamiltonian size allows us to implement tiled circuit ensembles and deploy the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to estimate the ground state energy. We adopt a hybrid quantum error mitigation strategy combining Readout Error Mitigation (REM), Symmetry Verification (SV) and Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). This approach yields high-accuracy energy estimates, achieving error rates on the order of 0.01% and thus demonstrating the potential of near-term quantum devices for probing frustrated quantum materials.",

    "summary": "In quantum many-body physics, one aims to understand emergent phenomena and effects of strong interactions, ideally by developing a simple theoretical picture. Recently, progress in quantum simulators has enabled the measurement of site resolved snapshots of Fermi-Hubbard systems at finite doping on square as well as triangular lattice geometries. These experimental advances pose the quest for theorists to analyze the ensuing data in order to gain insights into these prototypical, strongly correlated many-body systems. Here we employ machine learning techniques to optimize the mean-field parameters of a resonating valence bond (RVB) state through comparison with experimental data, thus determining a possible underlying simple model that is physically motivated and fully interpretable. We find that the resulting RVB states are capable of capturing two- as well as three-point correlations measured in experiments, even when they are not specifically used in the optimization. The analysis of the mean-field parameters and their doping dependence can be used to obtain physical insights and shed light on the nature of possible underlying quantum spin liquid states. Our results show that finite temperature data from Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators can be well captured by RVB states. This work paves the way for a new, systematic analysis of data from numerical as well as quantum simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.",

    "summary": "Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems have emerged as a powerful framework for describing open quantum systems, non-equilibrium dynamics, and engineered quantum optical materials. However, solving the ground-state properties of NH systems is challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space, and exotic phenomena such as the emergence of exceptional points. Another challenge arises from the limitations of traditional methods like exact diagonalization (ED). For the past decade, neural networks (NN) have shown promise in approximating many-body wavefunctions, yet their application to NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore different NN architectures to investigate the ground-state properties of a parity-time-symmetric, one-dimensional NH, transverse field Ising model with a complex spectrum by employing a recurrent neural network (RNN), a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). We construct the NN-based many-body wavefunctions and validate our approach by recovering the ground-state properties of the model for small system sizes, finding excellent agreement with ED. Furthermore, for larger system sizes, we demonstrate that the RNN outperforms both the RBM and MLP. However, we show that the accuracy of the RBM and MLP can be significantly improved through transfer learning, allowing them to perform comparably to the RNN for larger system sizes. These results highlight the potential of neural network-based approaches--particularly for accurately capturing the low-energy physics of NH quantum systems.",

    "summary": "Advancing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology into the sub-1-nm angstr\\\"om-scale technology nodes is expected to involve alternative semiconductor channel materials, as silicon transistors encounter severe performance degradation at physical gate lengths below 10 nm. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have emerged as strong candidates for overcoming short-channel effects due to their atomically thin bodies, which inherently suppress electrostatic leakage and improve gate control in aggressively scaled field-effect transistors (FETs). Among the growing library of 2D materials, the MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family -- a synthetic septuple-layered materials -- has attracted increasing attention for its remarkable ambient stability, suitable bandgaps, and favorable carrier transport characteristics, making it a promising platform for next-generation transistors. While experimental realization of sub-10-nm 2D FETs remains technologically demanding, computational device simulation using first-principles density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function transport simulations provide a powerful and cost-effective route for exploring the performance limits and optimal design of ultrascaled FET. This review consolidates the current progress in the computational design of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. We review the physical properties of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ that makes them compelling candidates for transistor applications, as well as the simulated device performance and optimization strategy of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. Finally, we identify key challenges and research gaps, and outline future directions that could accelerate the practical deployment of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FET in the angstr\\\"om-scale CMOS era.",

In this computational study, we used charge-informed molecular dynamics with a fine-tuned CHGNet foundation potential to investigate the phase transformation in Li$_{x}$Mn$_{0.8}$Ti$_{0.1}$O$_{1.9}$F$_{0.1}$. Our results indicate that transition metal migration occurs and reorders to form the spinel-like ordering in an FCC anion framework. The transformed structure contains a higher concentration of non-transition metal (0-TM) face-sharing channels, which are known to improve Li transport kinetics. Analysis of the Mn valence distribution suggests that the appearance of tetrahedral Mn$^{2+}$ is a consequence of spinel-like ordering, rather than the trigger for cation migration as previously believed. Calculated equilibrium intercalation voltage profiles demonstrate that the $\\delta$-phase, unlike the ordered spinel, exhibits solid-solution signatures during the 0-TM to Li$_{\\text{tet}}$ conversion reaction. A higher Li capacity is obtained than in the DRX phase. This study provides atomic insights into solid-state phase transformation and its relation to experimental electrochemistry, highlighting the potential of charge-informed machine learning interatomic potentials for understanding complex oxide materials.",

    "summary": "Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.",

    "summary": "The development of machine-learning models for atomic-scale simulations has benefited tremendously from the large databases of materials and molecular properties computed in the past two decades using electronic-structure calculations. More recently, these databases have made it possible to train universal models that aim at making accurate predictions for arbitrary atomic geometries and compositions. The construction of many of these databases was however in itself aimed at materials discovery, and therefore targeted primarily to sample stable, or at least plausible, structures and to make the most accurate predictions for each compound - e.g. adjusting the calculation details to the material at hand. Here we introduce a dataset designed specifically to train machine learning models that can provide reasonable predictions for arbitrary structures, and that therefore follows a different philosophy. Starting from relatively small sets of stable structures, the dataset is built to contain massive atomic diversity (MAD) by aggressively distorting these configurations, with near-complete disregard for the stability of the resulting configurations. The electronic structure details, on the other hand, are chosen to maximize consistency rather than to obtain the most accurate prediction for a given structure, or to minimize computational effort. The MAD dataset we present here, despite containing fewer than 100k structures, has already been shown to enable training universal interatomic potentials that are competitive with models trained on traditional datasets with two to three orders of magnitude more structures. We describe in detail the philosophy and details of the construction of the MAD dataset. We also introduce a low-dimensional structural latent space that allows us to compare it with other popular datasets and that can be used as a general-purpose materials cartography tool.",

    "summary": "Raman spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for characterizing molecules and materials that is used in many laboratories. First-principles theoretical calculations of Raman spectra are important because they elucidate the microscopic effects underlying Raman activity in these systems. These calculations are often performed using the canonical harmonic approximation which cannot capture certain thermal changes in the Raman response. Anharmonic vibrational effects were recently found to play crucial roles in several materials, which motivates theoretical treatments of the Raman effect beyond harmonic phonons. While Raman spectroscopy from molecular dynamics (MD-Raman) is a well-established approach that includes anharmonic vibrations and further relevant thermal effects, MD-Raman computations were long considered to be computationally too expensive for practical materials computations. In this perspective article, we highlight that recent advances in the context of machine learning have now dramatically accelerated the involved computational tasks without sacrificing accuracy or predictive power. These recent developments highlight the increasing importance of MD-Raman and related methods as versatile tools for theoretical prediction and characterization of molecules and materials.",

We vastly enhanced visibility of grains with ion beam treatment and performed accurate grain segmentation using deep neural network (DNN). By leveraging our new method, we discovered unexpected discrepancies that contradict previous results, such as deposition temperature (Tdep) and post-metallization annealing (PMA) dependence of grain size statistics, prompting us to reassess earlier interpretations. Combining microstructural analysis with electrical tests, we found that grain size reduction had both positive and negative outcomes: it caused significant diminishing of die-to-die variation (~68 % decrease in standard deviation) in coercive field (Ec), while triggering an upsurge in leakage current. These uncovered results signify robustness of our method in characterization of ferroelectric hafnia for in-depth examination of both device variability and reliability.",

In magnetically ordered materials, magnons - the quanta of spin waves - exhibit intrinsic nonlinearities that are of great interest in fundamental research and practical applications. Despite progress in the nonlinear control of magnon modes in antiferromagnetic materials, the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regimes of magnon coherences has remained elusive. Here, we explore the nonlinear dynamics of a magnon mode in an antiferromagnet using two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy with waveguide-enhanced terahertz fields. By driving the magnon mode far from equilibrium, we demonstrate the emergence of high-order magnon coherences and delineate a distinct transition into non-perturbative magnon nonlinearities. This behavior originates from the intrinsic anharmonicity of the magnetic potential and marks a regime dominated by magnon self-interactions at large spin deflection angles. These findings provide fundamental mechanistic insights that might be exploited for ultrafast switching and other advanced magnonic applications.",

Achieving optimal growth conditions requires precise control of process and furnace design parameters. Still, data scarcity -- especially for new materials -- limits the application of machine learning (ML) in predictive modeling and optimization. This study proposes a transfer learning approach to overcome this limitation by adapting ML models trained on a higher data volume of one source material (Si) to a lower data volume of another target material (Ge and GaAs). The materials were deliberately selected to assess the robustness of the transfer learning approach in handling varying data similarity, with Cz-Ge being similar to Cz-Si, and GaAs grown via the liquid encapsulated Czochralski method (LEC), which differs from Cz-Si. We explore various transfer learning strategies, including Warm Start, Merged Training, and Hyperparameters Transfer, and evaluate multiple ML architectures across two different materials. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly enhances predictive accuracy with minimal data, providing a practical framework for optimizing Cz growth parameters across diverse materials.",

    "summary": "Large-scale foundation models, including neural network interatomic potentials (NIPs) in computational materials science, have demonstrated significant potential. However, despite their success in accelerating atomistic simulations, NIPs face challenges in directly predicting electronic properties and often require coupling to higher-scale models or extensive simulations for macroscopic properties. Machine learning (ML) offers alternatives for structure-to-property mapping but faces trade-offs: feature-based methods often lack generalizability, while deep neural networks require significant data and computational power. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HackNIP, a two-stage pipeline that leverages pretrained NIPs. This method first extracts fixed-length feature vectors (embeddings) from NIP foundation models and then uses these embeddings to train shallow ML models for downstream structure-to-property predictions. This study investigates whether such a hybridization approach, by ``hacking\" the NIP, can outperform end-to-end deep neural networks, determines the dataset size at which this transfer learning approach surpasses direct fine-tuning of the NIP, and identifies which NIP embedding depths yield the most informative features. HackNIP is benchmarked on Matbench, evaluated for data efficiency, and tested on diverse tasks including \\textit{ab initio}, experimental, and molecular properties. We also analyze how embedding depth impacts performance. This work demonstrates a hybridization strategy to overcome ML trade-offs in materials science, aiming to democratize high-performance predictive modeling.",

    "summary": "Polycrystalline materials have numerous applications due to their unique properties, which are often determined by the grain boundaries. Hence, quantitative characterization of grain as well as interface orientation is essential to optimize these materials, particularly energy materials. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy, matter can be analysed in an extremely fine grid of scan points via electron diffraction patterns at each scan point. By matching the diffraction patterns to a simulated database, the crystal orientation of the material as well as the orientation of the grain boundaries at each scan point can be determined. This pattern matching approach is highly time intensive. Artificial intelligence promises to be a very powerful tool for pattern recognition. In this work, we train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on dynamically simulated diffraction patterns of LiNiO2, an important cathode-active material for Lithium-ion batteries, to predict the orientation of grains in terms of three Euler angles for the complete fundamental orientation region. Results demonstrate that these networks outperform the conventional pattern matching algorithm with increased accuracy and efficiency. The increased accuracy of the CNN models can be attributed to the fact that these models are trained by data incorporating dynamical effects. This work is the first attempt to apply deep learning for analysis of electron diffraction data and enlightens the great potential of ML to accelerate the analysis of electron microscopy data, toward high-throughput characterization technique.",

Conventional benchmarking methods (e.g., charge transport, confocal mapping, electron or scanning probe microscopy) are slow, perturb sample quality, or involve trade-offs between speed, resolution, and scan area. To accelerate assessment of 2D semiconductors, we demonstrate a broadband, wide-field hyperspectral optical microscope for 2D materials (2D-HOM) that rapidly captures a spatial-spectral data cube within seconds. The data cube includes x-y spatial coordinate (a 300 * 300 $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$ field, with ~ 1 $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ resolution) and a selectable wavelength range between 1100 to 200 nm at each pixel. Using synthesized films and heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides ($\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{WS}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{V}_{x}\\mathrm{W}_{1-x}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{WSe}_{2}$), we show that this cost-effective technique detects spectral fingerprints of material identity, doping, grain boundaries, and alloy composition, and enables advanced analysis, including unsupervised machine learning for spatial segmentation.",

Here, through the combination of first principles dynamical mean field theory calculations and epitaxial growth of the single-layer FeX (X=Se, S, Te) on SrTiO$_3$ (STO)(001) substrate, which facilitates the controlled distortion of the FeX$_4$ tetrahedron, we demonstrate an unique superconducting dome where the superconducting gap peaks at a `magic' angle of the FeX$_4$ tetrahedron and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) for the A$_{1g}$ mode is maximized for the FeSe film. Our findings uncover a significant role of electronic correlations in strengthening Cooper pairing in unconventional superconductors by enhancing EPC.",

Using a self-consistent hybridization expansion based on the Non-Crossing Approximation (NCA) we compute the dynamics of the impurity, its steady-state and spectral function. We show that the interplay between strong Coulomb repulsion and correlated dissipation gives rise to robust signatures of Kondo physics both at weak and strong losses. These include a strongly suppressed spin relaxation rate, displaying a characteristic Kondo-Zeno crossover and a spectral function where doublon band is quickly destroyed by dissipation while the coherent Kondo peak remains visible for weak losses, then disappears at intermediate values and finally re-emerge as the system enters in the Kondo-Zeno regime. As compared to the case of single particle losses we show that two-body dissipation protects Kondo physics. The picture obtained with NCA is confirmed by numerical simulations of exact dynamics on finite-size chains. We interpret these results using a dissipative Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which leads to an effective Kondo model with residual impurity-bath losses which are suppressed by strong correlations or strong losses.",

We analyze the resulting logical operators, whose existence depends on the system size, as well as the structure of gapped boundaries and a tensor network representation of the ground state. Furthermore, when confinement is enforced in both directions, fractal-like excitations emerge, resulting in unpaired logical operators.   We extend our construction to 3D models, such as the surface code and the X-cube model, leading to novel dipole-loop and dipole-planon excitations that arise from bounding confined excitations. These modifications are implemented through group cohomological twistings--projective representations of finite groups--with most examples based on Z2xZ2.",

In this work we will present an implementation of non-collinear TDDFT for the INQ code to simulate spin dynamics in real time and discuss the implementation of non-collinear magnetic effects into the code. We will discuss the implementation of exchange-correlation magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling, and the interaction between the electronic system and external magnetic fields. We will then consider several prototypical examples of spin dynamics in magnetic clusters and solids after light excitation. Potential applications range from the study of real-time dynamics of magnons to ultrafast spin dynamics under linear and circularly polarized laser excitation, as well as spectroscopic signatures such as magnetic circular dichroism and pump-probe Kerr rotation.",

To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.",

The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.",

    "summary": "We investigate the magnetotransport properties of a diluted half-filled one-band Hubbard model with second-nearest-neighbor hopping on a simple cubic lattice, aiming to explore the possibility of metallicity in diluted antiferromagnetic systems. Our semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials. This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that when the on-site repulsion strength ($U$) is set to zero on a percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably, this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.",

CrMnSb, having a valence electron count of 18, has been proposed to exhibit compensated ferrimagnetic character instead of the expected nonmagnetic semiconducting ground state. As half-Heusler systems with a valence electron count of 18 are not known to exhibit magnetic ordering, we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of CrMnSb using a combination of density functional theory and Green's function-based multiple-scattering theory. We show that, despite satisfying the 18 valence electron Slater-Pauling rule, CrMnSb does not exhibit ground-state nonmagnetic semiconducting behavior. Instead, it reveals a half-metallic, fully compensated ferrimagnetic ground state. This anomaly originates from the presence of localized sublattice moments, resulting from antiparallel alignment between Cr and Mn sublattices, which enforces half-metallic ferrimagnetism despite its ideal 18 valence electron count.",

We performed a comprehensive search for new hard magnetic materials in the ternary Fe-Co-Zr space by leveraging a scalable, machine learning-assisted materials discovery framework running on GPU-enabled exascale computing resources. This framework integrates crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) machine learning (ML) method with first-principles calculations to efficiently navigate the vast composition-structure space. The efficiency and accuracy of the ML approach enable us to reveal 9 new thermodynamically stable ternary Fe-Co-Zr compounds and 81 promising low-energy metastable phases with their formation energies within 0.1 eV/atom above the convex hull. The predicted compounds span a wide range of crystal symmetries and magnetic behaviors, providing a rich platform for tuning functional properties. Based on the analysis of site-specific magnetic properties, we show that the Fe6Co17Zr6 compound obtained from our ML discovery can be further optimized by chemical doping. Chemical substitutions lead to a ternary Fe5Co18Zr6 phase with a strong anisotropy of K1 = 1.1 MJ/m3, and a stable quaternary magnetic Fe5Co16Zr6Mn4 compound.",

A machine learning framework is developed to accelerate the parameterization of interatomic force fields (FFs), enabling molecular dynamics simulations of three nanocrystalline models: (i) a meta-atom (MA) mode representing the RHEA as a hypothetical sing-element system with averaged properties, (ii) a quinary RSS model with randomly distributed constituent atoms, and (iii) a Monte Carlo (MC) model with internal CSRO. The results reveal that RSS enhances strength, while CSRO reduces flow stress level but improves strain hardening and failure resistance. A transition from Hall-Petch (HP) strengthening to inverse Hall-Petch (IHP) softening is observed, with CSRO suppressing this transition. The underlying plastic mechanisms (i.e., dislocation slip, deformation twinning, phase transformation and grain boundary movements) are analyzed from both nanostructural and energetic perspectives. Theoretical models are established to describe the size-dependent yield strength and predict the critical grain size. Additionally, the contributions of different plastic mechanisms to the overall stress response are separately quantified. These findings provide new insights into the design and performance optimization of RHEAs through nanostructural engineering.",

However, the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$NiO$_4$ under pressure and doping remain surprisingly underexplored. Here, we investigate these properties using density-functional-theory calculations. We find that its tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure can be stabilized, not only under comparatively low pressures of $\\sim$ 8 GPa, but also at ambient pressure via the partial substitution of La with Ba. Moreover, we show that the combined effects of Ba substitution and pressure leads to qualitative changes in the electronic structure towards the formal $d^{7.5}$ configuration of the superconducting bilayer nickelates. Further, while La$_2$NiO$_4$ can undergo a insulator-metal transition with pressure retaining G-type antiferromagnetic order, La$_{1.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$NiO$_4$ exhibits metallic behavior with an enhanced competition between different magnetic states. Our results thus offer new insights into the interplay of structure, doping, and magnetism across the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series.",

This new setup was tested on a variety of samples. We present results on the metal-insulator transition in InAs and we report notably the first observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations in WTe$_{2}$ at magnetic fields beyond 100 T.",

    "summary": "Geometric frustration is a key ingredient in the emergence of exotic states of matter, such as the quantum spin liquid in Mott insulators. While there has been intense interest in experimentally tuning frustration in candidate materials, achieving precise and continuous control has remained a major hurdle -- particularly in accessing the properties of the ideally frustrated lattice. Here, we show that large, finely controlled anisotropic strains can effectively tune the degree of geometric frustration in the Mott insulating $\\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ -- a slightly anisotropic triangular-lattice quantum magnet. Using thermodynamic measurements of the elastocaloric effect, we experimentally map out a temperature-strain phase diagram that captures both the ground state of the isotropic lattice and the less frustrated parent state. Our results provide a new benchmark for calculations of the triangular-lattice Hubbard model as a function of frustration and highlight the power of lattice engineering as a route to realizing perfectly frustrated quantum materials.",

We focus on the low-temperature scaling of normalized spin current $\\tilde{I}_S$ through the interface, and benchmark our approach on 1D Heisenberg chain, with the negative spinon spin current reproduced. In addition, we find an algebraic scaling $\\tilde{I}_S \\sim T^{\\alpha}$ with varying exponent $\\alpha$ in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with characteristic spin-current signatures distinguishing different magnetic phases. Remarkably, we discover a persistent spin current $\\tilde{I}_S$ in the spin supersolid phase, which saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $\\tilde{I}_S \\sim T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence in SSE - provide sensitive experimental probes for investigating spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Moreover, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.",

Performing counting measurements on the environment gives rise to stochastic dynamics of quantum trajectories for the system, which when averaged yield back the quantum master equation. In this work, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which the dynamics of these different descriptions retain the weak symmetry of the quantum master equation and we characterise the resulting symmetries of the different descriptions in terms of their generators. We find that the joint dynamics always features a separable symmetry directly related to that of the quantum master equation, but for quantum trajectories the corresponding symmetry is present only if the counting measurement satisfies certain conditions.",

However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such triple-layer networks, which reduces the computational complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(D^{12})$ in conventional methods to $\\mathcal{O}(D^{9})$. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, while also providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.",

This extension employs complete non-exponential basis expansions for the bath correlation functions, thereby generalizing the applicability of the cNMSSE framework beyond environments with Debye-type spectral structures. By preserving the wavefunction-based description and favorable linear-scaling properties, the extended cNMSSE offers an efficient and flexible approach to simulate non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The method is implemented within a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved numerically via matrix product state (MPS) techniques. Benchmark simulations on four representative cases, including discrete spectra, Ohmic spectra with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral densities, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward-backward stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM). The extended cNMSSE thus provides a robust and scalable framework for accurate simulations of non-Markovian open quantum systems with general environments.",

In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.",

    "summary": "Free theories are landmarks in the landscape of quantum field theories: their exact solvability serves as a pillar for perturbative constructions of interacting theories. Fuzzy sphere regularization, which combines quantum Hall physics with state-operator correspondence, has recently been proposed as a promising framework for simulating three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), but so far it has not provided access to free theories. We overcome this limitation by designing a bilayer quantum Hall system that hosts an Ising tricritical point -- a nontrivial fixed point where first-order and second-order transitions meet -- which flows to the conformally coupled scalar theory in the infrared. The critical energy spectrum and operator structure match those at the Gaussian fixed point, providing nonperturbative evidence for the emergence of a free scalar CFT. Our results expand the landscape of CFTs realizable on the fuzzy sphere and demonstrate that even free bosonic theories -- previously inaccessible -- can emerge from interacting electrons in this framework.",

This gives a formal setting for topological holography, where the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules of the physical boundary algebra captures the bulk topological order.   In this article, we extend the LTO axioms to quantum spin systems equipped with a topological boundary, again producing a physical boundary algebra for the bulk-boundary system, whose category of (topological) boundary DHR bimodules recovers the topological boundary order. We perform this analysis in explicit detail for Levin-Wen and Walker-Wang bulk-boundary systems.   Along the way, we introduce a 2D braided categorical net of algebras built from a unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). Such nets arise as boundary algebras of Walker-Wang models. We consider the canonical state on this braided categorical net corresponding to the standard topological boundary for the Walker-Wang model. Interestingly, in this state, the cone von Neumann algebras are type I with finite dimensional centers, in contrast with the type II and III cone von Neumann algebras from the Levin-Wen models studied in [arXiv:2307.12552]. Their superselection sectors recover the underlying unitary category of our UBFC, and we conjecture the superselection category also captures the fusion and braiding.",

Recognizing that unitary matrices form a mathematical manifold, we employ Riemannian optimization methods -- specifically the Riemannian trust-region algorithm -- which involves second derivative calculations with respect to the gates. Our key technical contribution is a matrix-free algorithmic framework that avoids the explicit construction and storage of large unitary matrices acting on the whole Hilbert space. Instead, we evaluate all quantities as sums over state vectors, assuming that these vectors can be stored in memory. We develop HPC-optimized kernels for applying gates to state vectors and for the gradient and Hessian computation. Further improvements are achieved by exploiting sparsity structures due to Hamiltonian conservation laws, such as parity conservation, and lattice translation invariance. We benchmark our implementation on the Fermi-Hubbard model with up to 16 sites, demonstrating a nearly linear parallelization speed-up with up to 112 CPU threads. Finally, we compare our implementation with an alternative matrix product operator-based approach.",

We present advances in the research program of causal decompositions, which investigates the existence of an equivalence between the causal and the compositional structures of unitary channels. Our results concern one-dimensional Quantum Cellular Automata (1D QCAs), i.e. unitary channels over a line of $N$ quantum systems (with or without periodic boundary conditions) that feature a causality radius $r$: a given input cannot causally influence outputs at a distance more than $r$. We prove that, for $N \\geq 4r + 1$, 1D QCAs all admit causal decompositions: a unitary channel is a 1D QCA if and only if it can be decomposed into a unitary routed circuit of nearest-neighbour interactions, in which its causal structure is compositionally obvious. This provides the first constructive form of 1D QCAs with causality radius one or more, fully elucidating their structure. In addition, we show that this decomposition can be taken to be translation-invariant for the case of translation-invariant QCAs. Our proof of these results makes use of innovative algebraic techniques, leveraging a new framework for capturing partitions into non-factor sub-C* algebras.",

We investigate the effectiveness of several quantum error mitigation strategies, including self-mitigation, by simulating quantum quench dynamics for Heisenberg spin chains with system sizes up to 104 qubits using IBM quantum processors. In particular, we discuss the limitations of zero-noise extrapolation and the advantages offered by self-mitigation at a large scale. The self-mitigation method shows stable accuracy with the large systems of 104 qubits with more than 3,000 CNOT gates. Also, we combine the discussed quantum error mitigation methods with practical entanglement entropy measuring methods, and it shows a good agreement with the theoretical estimation. Our study illustrates the usefulness of near-term noisy quantum hardware in examining the quantum quench dynamics of many-body systems at large scales, and lays the groundwork for surpassing classical simulations with quantum methods prior to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.",

While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light, offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks. This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings, technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations, improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols. These developments, combined with ongoing improvements in quantum photonic integration, pave the way for the practical deployment of large-scale, high-speed quantum-secure networks.",

We also introduce MTDMRG-X, a new algorithm that combines DMRG-X with multi-target DMRG to efficiently compute excited states even in regimes with strong eigenstate hybridization. We showcase the use of these methods for the analysis of long-range couplings in a multi-transmon Hamiltonian including qubits and couplers, and we discuss eigenstate localization.

    "summary": "Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank parameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we demonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly, we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover certain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require the density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm requires just $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d \\times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.",

Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one U(1) conserved quantity.",

As a critical many-body state, we focus on the critical transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) described by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT). We show that even if we modify the non-selective projective measurement assumed in R\\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information by replacing the measurement into decoherence by environment, the R\\'{e}nyi generalized Shannon mutual information maintains the CFT properties such as subsystem CFT scaling law and its central charge observed through both the conventional R\\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information and R\\'{e}nyi mutual information. Furthermore, we apply a local decoherence to the critical ground state of the TFIM and numerically observe the R\\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information by changing the parameter controlling environment effect (corresponding to the strength of measurement) in the R\\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information and the strength of the decoherence to which the entire system subjects.

    "summary": "False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) plays a central role in cosmology and particle physics but has remained intractable for classical simulation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We present a novel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a self-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice of bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert space whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the Hamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing the ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable quantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a tensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding to the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space. Using a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time evolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In (1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent entanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach establishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.",

    "summary": "Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data, such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "summary": "LiNiO2 is a promising cathode material for Li-ion battery but its atomic and electronic structure is under debate. Indeed, two sets of Ni-O distances are identified from local structural probes that are related with either Jahn-Teller distortion or bond disproportionation of NiO6 octahedra. Moreover, LiNiO2 undergoes a monoclinic to rhombohedral transition at 200 K which origin is still unclear. On the other hand, isostructural NaNiO2 shows differences from LiNiO2, as it is a well-known Jahn-Teller distorted system, and it undergoes monoclinic to rhombohedral transition at 500 K associated to the loss of the Jahn-Teller distortion. To understand better these differences, we report here Ni L3-edge Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments on LiNiO2 and NaNiO2 at different temperatures (25 to 520 K) and follow the spectral changes below and above the phase transition temperatures. The observed RIXS spectra and the mapping indicate strong spectral changes for NaNiO2 confirming the disappearance of Jahn-Teller distortion during phase transition while the changes are minor for LiNiO2 suggesting very few modifications in the local structure. Theoretical simulations of RIXS spectra are required for further understanding, however, we believe that the reported dataset can be a crucial resource for developing advanced simulations that are essential to deepening our understanding of the atomic and electronic structure of these nickelates.",

Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized within their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization mechanism in many-body systems.",

In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.",

As part of the Munich Quantum Valley (MQV) ecosystem, the course fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between technical and business students, equipping them with the skills necessary to contribute to or lead in the emerging quantum industry. The QEL curriculum integrates two complementary tracks. First, technical students form teams where they engage in cutting-edge, industry-relevant research topics under academic supervision. Meanwhile business students in a parallel course explore commercialization strategies, risks, and opportunities within the quantum technology landscape. Midway through the semester, a selection of the business students join the technical course to form interdisciplinary teams which assess the feasibility of transforming scientific concepts into viable business solutions. The course culminates in three key deliverables: a publication-style technical report, a white paper analyzing the business potential and financial requirements, and a startup pitch presented to the quantum community at a Demo Day. This work outlines the course structure, objectives, and outcomes, providing a model for other institutions seeking to cultivate a highly skilled, innovation-driven workforce in quantum science and technology.",

However, current 2D material databases are constrained by limited scale and compositional diversity. In this study, we introduce a scalable active learning workflow that integrates deep neural networks with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to efficiently explore a vast set of candidate structures. These structures are generated through physics-informed elemental substitution strategies, enabling broad and systematic discovery of stable 2D materials. Through six iterative screening cycles, we established the creation of the Monolayer 2D Materials Database (ML2DDB), which contains 242,546 DFT-validated stable structures-an order-of-magnitude increase over the largest known 2D materials databases. In particular, the number of ternary and quaternary compounds showed the most significant increase. Combining this database with a generative diffusion model, we demonstrated effective structure generation under specified chemistry and symmetry constraints. This work accomplished an organically interconnected loop of 2D material data expansion and application, which provides a new paradigm for the discovery of new materials.",

    "summary": "Spin ice systems represent a prime example of constrained spin systems and exhibit rich low-energy physics. In this study, we explore how introducing a tunable anisotropic spin coupling to the conventional Ising spin ice Hamiltonian on the breathing pyrochlore lattice affects the ground state properties of the system. Significant changes are observed in the ground state structure, reflected in the spin structure factor and in a reduction of residual entropy at low temperatures. We theoretically uncover a rich phase diagram by varying the anisotropy and demonstrate how this modification reduces the ground state degeneracy across different phases. Numerical simulations reveal that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the system either undergoes a crossover into a constrained spin ice manifold, characterized by an entropy density that drops below the Pauling entropy of conventional spin ice, or a phase transition into a symmetry-broken state, depending on the perturbations. Additionally, we compute the spin structure factors for the anisotropic model and compare these results to analytical predictions from a large-$N$ expansion, finding good agreement. This work develops the understanding of spin ice in anisotropic limits, which may be experimentally realized by strain, providing, among others, key signatures in entropy and specific heat.",

    "summary": "Accurate grain orientation mapping is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of polycrystalline materials, particularly in energy-related applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its electrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated, using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural characterization.",

    "summary": "The nuclear quantum effects of hydrogen play a significant role in determining the phase stability of water ice. Hydrogen-bond symmetrization occurs as hydrogen atoms tunnel in a double-well potential, ultimately occupying the midpoint between oxygen atoms and transforming ice VIII into ice X under high pressure. Quantum fluctuations lower this transition from classical predictions of over 100 GPa to 60 GPa. We reveal that the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional underestimates the hydrogen double-well barrier, thus resulting in a transition pressure over 10 GPa lower than the strongly constrained and appropriately normed functional, which is validated against quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Nuclear quantum anharmonicity, treated via neural canonical transformation (NCT), reveals that this transition pressure is temperature-independent and observes a 2 GPa reduction when comparing the non-Gaussian flow models based wavefunction compared to the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Despite increasing pressure typically shortens chemical bonds and hardens phonon modes, NCT calculations reveal that hydrogen bond softens hydrogen-oxygen stretching in ice VIII upon pressure.",

    "summary": "Accurately predicting magnetic behavior across diverse materials systems remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex interplay of structural and electronic factors and is pivotal for the accelerated discovery and design of next-generation magnetic materials. In this work, a refined descriptor is proposed that significantly improves the prediction of two critical magnetic properties -- magnetic ordering (Ferromagnetic vs. Ferrimagnetic) and magnetic moment per atom -- using only the structural information of materials. Unlike previous models limited to Mn-based or lanthanide-transition metal compounds, the present approach generalizes across a diverse dataset of 5741 stable, binary and ternary, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds sourced from the Materials Project. Leveraging an enriched elemental vector representation and advanced feature engineering, including nonlinear terms and reduced matrix sparsity, the LightGBM-based model achieves an accuracy of 82.4% for magnetic ordering classification and balanced recall across FM and FiM classes, addressing a key limitation in prior studies. The model predicts magnetic moment per atom with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, surpassing the Hund's matrix and orbital field matrix descriptors. Additionally, it accurately estimates formation energy per atom, enabling assessment of both magnetic behavior and material stability. This generalized and computationally efficient framework offers a robust tool for high-throughput screening of magnetic materials with tailored properties.",

    "summary": "The physics of strongly correlated fermions described by Hubbard or $t$-$J$ models in the underdoped regime -- relevant for high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate compounds -- remains a subject of ongoing debate. In particular, the nature of charge carriers in this regime is poorly understood, in part due to the unusual properties of their spectral function. In this Letter, we present unbiased numerical results for the one-hole spectral function in a $t$-$J$ model at finite temperatures. Our study provides valuable insights into the underlying physics of magnetic (or spin-) polaron formation in a doped antiferromagnet (AFM). For example, we find how the suppression of spectral weight outside the magnetic Brillouin zone -- a precursor of Fermi arc formation -- disappears with increasing temperature, revealing nearly-deconfined spinon excitations of the undoped AFM. The pristine setting we consider can be directly explored using quantum simulators. Our calculations demonstrate that coherent quasiparticle peaks associated with magnetic polarons can be observed up to temperatures $T>J$ above the spin-exchange $J$, routinely obtained in such experiments. This paves the way for future studies of the fate of magnetic polarons in the pseudogap phase.",

    "summary": "Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.",

    "summary": "Altermagnetism (AM), the recently discovered third class of collinear magnetic order, is characterized by non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin-split electronic structure with compensated zero net magnetization. It can arise from the conventional antiferromagnetism by introducing local anisotropy on the two opposite-spin sublattices, either through structural changes in local crystallographic symmetry or spontaneous emergence of local staggered orbital order from electron correlations in multi-orbital systems. Here, we demonstrate on the two-dimensional square lattice that a $d$-wave AM can emerge spontaneously in the single-orbital extended Hubbard model, without invoking the spin-orbital coupling and multi-orbital physics. We carry out mean-field studies on the concrete single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V$ model with $U$ and $V$ the onsite and nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, obtaining the ground states, analyzing their properties, and determining the phase diagram in the $U$-$V$ plane. The $d$-wave AM with novel spin-transport behavior is found to be stabilized in a wide region of the phase diagram when the system is doped away from half-filling, actualized by the coexistence of onsite antiferromagnetic order and complex $d$-wave nearest-neighbor spin bond orders. Our findings provide an alternative route to achieve AM and substantially expand the range of candidate AM materials.",

Using quantum field theory within the Keldysh formalism to directly access the self-energy and dynamical susceptibilities in real frequencies, as detailed in our recent publication (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.115128), the primary computational challenge is the full three-dimensional real-frequency dependence of the four-point vertex. Our codebase provides a fully MPI+OpenMP parallelized implementation of the functional renormalization group (fRG) and the self-consistent parquet equations within the parquet approximation. It leverages vectorization to handle the additional complexity imposed by the Keldysh formalism, using optimized data structures and highly performant integration routines. Going beyond the results shown in the previous publication, the code includes functionality to perform fRG calculations in the multiloop framework, at arbitrary loop order, including self-consistent self-energy iterations. Moreover, implementations of various regulators, such as hybridization, interaction, frequency, and temperature are supplied.",

    "summary": "Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.",

    "summary": "Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.",

    "summary": "Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that investigates the capabilities of quantum computers for learning tasks. While QML models can theoretically offer advantages such as exponential speed-ups, challenges in data loading and the ability to scale to relevant problem sizes have prevented demonstrations of such advantages on practical problems. In particular, the encoding of arbitrary classical data into quantum states usually comes at a high computational cost, either in terms of qubits or gate count. However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks. We further analyze the performance of various quantum classifiers, such as quantum kernel methods, parameterized quantum circuits, and tensor-network classifiers, and we compare them to convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focus on the performance of the quantum classifiers as we introduce nonlinear functions of the input state, e.g., by letting the circuit parameters depend on the input state.",

    "summary": "Materials with tailored quantum properties can be engineered from atomic scale assembly techniques, but existing methods often lack the agility and accuracy to precisely and intelligently control the manufacturing process. Here we demonstrate a fully autonomous approach for fabricating atomic-level defects using electron beams in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that combines advanced machine learning and automated beam control. As a proof of concept, we achieved controlled fabrication of MoS-nanowire (MoS-NW) edge structures by iterative and targeted exposure of $MoS_2$ monolayer to a focused electron beam to selectively eject sulfur atoms, utilizing high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging for feedback-controlled monitoring structural evolution of defects. A machine learning framework combining a random forest model and convolutional neural networks (CNN) was developed to decode the HAADF image and accurately identify atomic positions and species. This atomic-level information was then integrated into an autonomous decision-making platform, which applied predefined fabrication strategies to instruct beam control about atomic sites to be ejected. The selected sites were subsequently exposed to localized electron beam using an FPGA-controlled scan routine with precise control over beam positioning and duration. While the MoS-NW edge structures produced exhibit promising mechanical and electronic properties, the proposed autonomous fabrication framework is material-agnostic and can be extended to other 2D materials for the creation of diverse defect structures and heterostructures beyond $MoS_2$.",

We show that the Hilbert space is comprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary phase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical values. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the ground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the `Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space changes, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization techniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the ground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each eigenstate.",

    "summary": "The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.",

In this work, we present a novel integrated computational approach that combines machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles vibrational spectroscopy calculations to reveal how graphene oxidation alters interfacial water structure. Our simulations demonstrate that pristine graphene leaves the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water largely unperturbed, whereas graphene oxide (GO) with surface hydroxyls induces a pronounced $\\Delta f \\sim 100 cm^{-1}$ redshift of the free-OH vibrational band and a dramatic reduction in its amplitude. These spectral shifts in the computed surface-specific sum-frequency generation spectrum serve as sensitive molecular markers of the GO oxidation level, reconciling previously conflicting experimental observations. By providing a quantitative spectroscopic fingerprint of GO oxidation, our findings have broad implications for catalysis and electrochemistry, where the structuring of interfacial water is critical to performance.",

    "summary": "We present the first application of quantics tensor trains (QTTs) and tensor cross interpolation (TCI) to the solution of a full set of self-consistent equations for multivariate functions, the so-called parquet equations. We show that the steps needed to evaluate the equations (Bethe--Salpeter equations, parquet equation and Schwinger--Dyson equation) can be decomposed into basic operations on the QTT-TCI (QTCI) compressed objects. The repeated application of these operations does not lead to a loss of accuracy beyond a specified tolerance and the iterative scheme converges even for numerically demanding parameters. As examples we take the Hubbard model in the atomic limit and the single impurity Anderson model, where the basic objects in parquet equations, the two-particle vertices, depend on three frequencies, but not on momenta. The results show that this approach is able to overcome major computational bottlenecks of standard numerical methods. The applied methods allow for an exponential increase of the number of grid points included in the calculations leading to an exponentially improving computational error for a linear increase in computational cost.",

    "summary": "Due to significant progress in quantum gas microscopy in recent years, there is a rapidly growing interest in real-space properties of single mobile dopands created in correlated antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulators. However, a detailed numerical description remains challenging, even for simple toy models. As a consequence, previous numerical simulations for large systems were largely limited to $T=0$. To provide guidance for cold-atom experiments, numerical calculations at finite temperature are required. Here, we numerically study the real-time properties of a single mobile hole in the 2D $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature and draw a comparison to features observed at $T=0$. We find that a three-stage process of hole motion, which was reported at $T=0$, is valid even at finite temperature. However, already at low temperatures, the average hole velocity at long times is not simply proportional to the spin coupling, contrary to the $T=0$ behavior. Comparing our finite-temperature numerical results with the experimental data from quantum gas microscopy we find a qualitative disagreement: in experiment, hole spreading speeds up with increasing $J/t$, while in our numerics it slows down. The latter is consistent with the numerical findings previously reported at $T=0$.",

    "summary": "The utility of near-term quantum computers for simulating realistic quantum systems hinges on the stability of digital quantum matter--realized when discrete quantum gates approximate continuous time evolution--and whether it can be maintained at system sizes and time scales inaccessible to classical simulations. Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.",

    "summary": "The transport across a Kondo-correlated quantum dot coupled to two leads with independent temperatures and chemical potentials is studied using a controlled non-perturbative, and in this sense exact numeric treatment based on a hybrid numerical renormalization group combined with time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (NRG-tDMRG). We find a peak in the conductance at finite voltage bias vs. the temperature gradient $\\Delta T = T_R - T_L$ across left and right lead. We then focus predominantly on zero voltage bias but finite $\\Delta T$ far beyond linear response. We reveal the dependence of the characteristic zero-bias conductance on the individual lead temperatures. We find that the finite-$\\Delta T$ data behaves quantitatively similar to linear response with an effective equilibrium temperature derived from the different lead temperatures. The regime of sign changes in the Seebeck coefficient, signaling the presence of Kondo correlations, and its dependence on the individual lead temperatures provide a complete picture of the Kondo regime in the presence of finite temperature gradients. The results from the zero-bias conductance and Seebeck coefficient studies unveil an approximate `Kondo circle' in the $T_L/T_R$ plane as the regime within which the Kondo correlations dominate. We also study the heat current and the corresponding heat conductance vs. finite $\\Delta T$. We provide a polynomial fit for our numerical results for the thermocurrent as a function of the individual lead temperatures which may be used to fit experimental data in the Kondo regime.",

We appreciate their suggestion to consider randomized SVD and address their constructive critique on the variational properties of CBE-DMRG. However, we strongly disagree with their proposal to omit the projection to the 2-site tangent space and explain its importance for efficient bond expansion. In particular, in the context of CBE applied to the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), we show that omitting this projection can lead to avoidable errors. Lastly, we emphasize the complementary roles of 3S mixing and CBE, reiterating our recommendation from Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023) to combine both methods (CBE+$\\alpha$). We provide examples to demonstrate the superior efficiency and robustness of CBE+$\\alpha$.",

    "summary": "Higher-from symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transitions characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-from symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.",

Notably, the reduced density matrix exhibits long-range or quasi-long-range order along the replica direction, revealing a universal entanglement feature in SPT phases. As a colloary, we generalized the framework of twisted R\\'enyi-N correlator to thermal states and open quantum systems, providing an alternative formulation of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, applicable to both closed and open systems.

    "summary": "Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a distinct and fundamental class of magnetic order. Exploring its interplay with quantum phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, density-wave instabilities, and many-body effects represents a compelling frontier. In this work, we theoretically confirm the presence of high-temperature metallic altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O. We demonstrate that the anomalous metal-insulator-metal transition arises from a Lifshitz transition associated with Fermi surface reconstruction. The previously reported spin-density wave gap is found to lie below the Fermi level in our study and is now recognized to be attributed to the V-shaped density of states, originating from orbital-selective and sublattice-resolved half-metal-like behavior on a specific V atom. Furthermore, we identify the instability from the nesting of spin-momentum-locked two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, which induces the SDW state. These findings position KV$_2$Se$_2$O as a promising platform for investigating the interplay among altermagnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and density-wave order.",

    "summary": "Charge ordering induced by strong short-range repulsion in itinerant fermion systems typically follows a two-sites alternation pattern. However, the covariance matrix spectrum of the one-dimensional, half-filled, spinless $t$-$V$ model reveals a post-Hartree-Fock picture at strong repulsion, with emergent four-site disruptions of the underlying staggered mean-field state. These disruptions are captured in a thermodynamically extensive manner by a compact four-fermion Coupled Cluster (doubles) state (CCS). Remarkably, all properties of this state may be computed analytically by combinatorial means, and also derived from an exactly solvable correlated hopping Hamiltonian. Furthermore, this Coupled Cluster state can be re-expressed as a low-rank Matrix Product State (MPS) with bond dimension exactly four. In addition, we unveil a hidden connection between this Coupled Cluster ansatz and a Rokhsar-Kivelson state (RKS), which is the ground state of a solvable parent quantum tetramer model. The broad picture that we uncover here thus provides deep connections between several core concepts of correlated fermions and quantum chemistry that have previously enjoyed limited synergy. In contrast to a recent perturbative treatment on top of Hartree-Fock theory, our approach asymptotically captures the correct correlations in the $t$-$V$ model at small $t/V$, and remains a qualitatively accurate approximation even outside the perturbative regime. Our results make the case for further studies of the covariance matrix for correlated electron systems in which ground states have non-trivial unit-cell structure.",

The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers, including worldwide trends in fabrication techniques and processes. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.",

    "summary": "The Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its generalisations to dissipative and dipolar gases have been very useful in describing dynamics of cold atomic gases, as well as polaritons and other nonlinear systems. For some of these applications the numerically accessible grid spacing can become a limiting factor, especially in describing turbulent dynamics and short-range effects of dipole-dipole interactions. We explore the application of tensor networks to these systems, where (in analogy to related work in fluid and plasma dynamics), they allow for physically motivated data compression that makes simulations possible on large spatial grids which would be unfeasible with direct numerical simulations. Analysing different non-equilibrium cases involving vortex formation, we find that these methods are particularly efficient, especially in combination with a matrix product operator representation of the quantum Fourier transform, which enables a spectral approach to calculation of both equilibrium states and time-dependent dynamics. The efficiency of these methods has interesting physical implications for the structure in the states that are generated by these dynamics, and provides a path to describe cold gas experiments that are challenging for existing methods.",

A key requirement for these pursuits is achieving control over local crystallographic and magnetic structure, usually through sample morphology (such as synthesis of bulk crystals versus thin-films) and application of magnetic or electric fields. Here we show that V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ can be crystallized in two ordered superlattices, distinguished by the periodicity of out-of-plane magnetic intercalants. Whereas one of these structures is metallic and displays the hallmarks of altermagnetism, the other superlattice, which has not been isolated before in this family of intercalation compounds, is a semimetallic noncollinear antiferromagnet that may enable access to topologically nontrivial properties. This observation of an unconventional superlattice structure establishes a powerful route for tailoring the tremendous array of magnetic and electronic behaviors hosted in related materials.",

This emerging technique brings multi-dimensional resolution to the ultrafast dynamics of nonequilibrium phases of matter, enabling new capabilities demanding precise coherent control and measurement of many-body dynamics and multi-order correlations. By mapping complex excitations across time and frequency dimensions, THz-2DCS delivers coherence tomography of driven quantum matter, thus revealing hidden excitation pathways, measuring higher order nonlinear response functions, disentangling various quantum pathways, capturing collective modes on ultrafast timescales and at terahertz frequencies. These experimental features frequently remain obscured in traditional single particle measurements, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, and equilibrium-based probes. This Review traces the early development of THz-2DCS and showcases significant recent progress in leveraging this technique to probe and manipulate quantum material properties, including nonequilibrium superconductivity, nonlinear magnonics, dynamical topological phases, and the detection of novel excitations and exotic collective modes with potential technological impact. Looking forward, we identify critical opportunities in advancing THz-2DCS instrumentation and experimental strategies that are shaping future applications in THz optoelectronics, quantum information processing, and sensing.",

By developing a Ginzburg--Landau theory based on microscopic models, we show that a phase-modulated Fulde--Ferrell superconducting state is stabilized via altermagnetic spin splitting, in contrast to the typical amplitude-modulated states that occur under a uniform Zeeman field. We apply our framework to different models: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. Our results indicate that the multi-sublattice structure is crucial for realizing this exotic superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring phase-modulated superconductivity without external magnetic fields.",

    "summary": "With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between two static charges in the $2+1$D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields, we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and trapped-ion quantum processors.",

Here, we predict novel real-space alternative piezomagnetic and piezoelectric responses in an emerging altermagnetic family of Lieb lattices, specifically transition-metal chalcogenides M2WS4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co). The unique S4T crystal-spin symmetry leads to distinct magnetic and electric responses depending on the direction of applied stress. When subjected to axial stress, they exhibit a giant piezomagnetic response, which is about one to two orders of magnitude larger than that of most piezomagnetic materials, while the residual C2 symmetry suppresses the piezoelectric effect. In contrast, diagonal stress induces an imbalance of oppositely aligned electric dipole moments and a significant piezoelectric response, while in-plane mirror symmetry inhibits the piezomagnetic effect. This alternative piezoresponse offers an unprecedented opportunity to precisely control electric and magnetic properties independently, opening new avenues for altermagnetic materials in high-fidelity multifunctional memory and sensor applications.",

In this study, we developed a high-throughput NEB computational framework integrated with the fine-tuned universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), enabling accelerated prediction of migration barriers based on transition state theory for the efficient discovery of fast-ion conductors. This framework automates the construction of initial/final states and migration paths, mitigating the inaccurate barriers prediction in pretrained potentials due to the insufficient training data on high-energy states. We employed the fine-tuned CHGNet model into NEB/MD calculations and the dual CHGNet-NEB/MD achieves a balance between computational speed and accuracy, as validated in NASICON-type Li$_{1+x}$Al$_x$Ti$_{2-x}$(PO$_4$)$_3$ (LATP) structures. Through high-throughput screening, we identified orthorhombic Pnma-group structures (LiMgPO$_4$, LiTiPO$_5$, etc.) which can serve as promising frameworks for fast ion conductors. Their aliovalent-doped variants, Li$_{0.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Al$_{0.5}$PO$_4$ and Li$_{0.5}$TiPO$_{4.5}$F$_{0.5}$, were predicted to possess low activation energies, as well as high ionic conductivity of 0.19 mS/cm and 0.024 mS/cm, respectively.",

    "summary": "Altermagnetism is a collinear compensated magnetically-ordered phase with a d, g or i-wave anisotropy and alternating spin polarization of the electronic structure in the position and momentum space. Its recent discovery was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. After summarizing the diverse research context, we turn the focus of this review to the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We start from the description of spontaneously broken and retained symmetries which delineate the compensated altermagnetic ordering as a distinct magnetic phase. Next we focus on microscopic signatures and ordering mechanism of the altermagnetic phase. We highlight crystal-structure realizations of a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities in altermagnets, ranging from weakly-interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators. The symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin-orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout the review we compare altermagnetism to traditional ferromagnetism and Neel antiferromagntism, and to the currently intensely explored magnetic phases with non-collinear symmetry-protected compensated spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions by references to relevant experiments.",

    "summary": "The recent proposal of altermagnetism has drawn widespread attention to antiferromagnet (AFM) exhibiting spin splitting, extending beyond the realm of sign-alternating spin splitting in momentum space protected solely by rotational symmetry. Herrin, we propose a shear-strain strategy that enables significant modulation of d-wave altermagnets into an non-alter compensated magnets. A comprehensive analysis combining the magnetic moment compensation characteristics of opposite spin sublattices with the distribution of spin-resolved conduction channels in momentum space under the [001] crystal orientation reveals that shear strain breaks the rotational symmetry of alternatmagnets. To explore the application potential of non-alter compensated magnets, we designe RuO2/TiO2/RuO2 magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) with three crystallographic orientations ((001), (110), (100)) and investigated their transport properties under shear strain. This non-alter electronic structure not only enhances the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in spin-split paths of intrinsic RuO2 (226% to 431%) but also enables substantial TMR in spin-degenerate paths (from 0-88%)). Our work provides guidelines for broadening magnetic materials and device platforms.",

The Hall-on-Toric phases appear in the vicinity of the transitions between deconfined $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ phases with different background charge per unit cell, in a fixed non-trivial flux background. We confirm their existence through extensive infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations, analyzing the topological entanglement entropy, entanglement spectra, and a generalized Hall conductance. Remarkably, the Hall-on-Toric states remain robust even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry. Our findings reinforce the foundational interpretation of star and plaquette defects as magnetic and electric excitations, and reveal that this perspective extends to a much deeper level.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.",

We address this question by identifying statistical correlations among sets of minimally four eigenstates that provide a unified framework for various measures of information scrambling. These include operator mutual information and operator entanglement entropy of the time-evolution operator, as well as more conventional diagnostics such as two-point dynamical correlations and out-of-time-ordered correlators. We demonstrate this framework by deriving exact results for eigenstate correlations in a minimal model of quantum chaos -- Floquet dual-unitary circuits. These results reveal not only the butterfly effect and the information lightcone, but also finer structures of scrambling within the lightcone. Our work thus shows how the eigenstates of a chaotic system can encode the full spatiotemporal anatomy of quantum chaos, going beyond the descriptions offered by random matrix theory and the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis.",

However, this contradicts recent exact results that at very low temperature charge transport rather is normal diffusive.

    "summary": "Spintronic devices typically employ heterostructures with ferromagnets which break time-reversal symmetry and have non-vanishing magnetization. With the growing class of materials that support spin-polarized carriers, current, and excitations,it is possible to envision emerging spintronic applications that are not limited to magnetoresistance. Here we focus on chiral perovskites with no net magnetization where the space-inversion and mirror symmetries are broken to induce chiral structure. The known importance of these perovskites is further expanded by the demonstration of the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). However, the generation of the spin-polarized carriers across the interface with these chiral perovskites remains to be fully understood. Our first-principles studies for two-dimensional PbBr$_4$-based chiral perovskites provide their electronic structure and an orbital-based symmetry analysis, which allows us to establish an effective Hamiltonian to elucidate the underlying origin of their chirality. We also use this analysis for the Edelstein effect, responsible for electrical generation of the nonequilibrium spin polarization in many materials, which in chiral perovskites could be a mechanism contributing to CISS. Furthermore, by examining optical properties of chiral perovskites and the opportunity to use them to realize tunable altermagnets, another class of zero-magnetization spintronic materials, we put forth a versatile materials platform for unconventional spintronics.",

    "summary": "The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\\lesssim 2\\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.",

    "summary": "Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.",

We conducted four independent runs, both with and without pressure-transmitting media. Up to 30 GPa, we observed no significant influence of the pressure medium on the pressure dependence of the $Ge-O$ bond length ($<R_{Ge-O}>$). Between 10 and 30 GPa, the evolution of $<R_{Ge-O}>$ shows substantial variability across our experiments and previous works. The measured values lie close to those reported for crystalline polymorphs, including the rutile- and $CaCl_{2}$-type phase of $GeO_{2}$. This finding suggests that the amorphous structure possesses considerable flexibility to transition among different atomic configurations. From 30 GPa to 158 GPa, our results for both $<R_{Ge-O}>$ and the non-bonded cation-cation distance $<R_{Ge...Ge}>$ demonstrate that edge-sharing octahedra remain the main structural motives in glassy $GeO_{2}$. Up to 100 GPa, compaction proceeds primarily via distortions of octahedral $O-Ge-O$ bond angles accompanied by octahedral bond shortening. Above 100 GPa, octahedral distortion becomes the prevailing mechanism. Compared to its crystalline analogues ($\\alpha-PbO_{2}$ and pyrite-like phase), glassy $GeO_{2}$ exhibits a slightly less efficient compaction mechanism, likely due to kinetic constraints that inhibit reconstructive lattice rearrangements.",

    "summary": "In soft matter science, it is often the goal to design new materials with targeted properties. These materials can be used in many applications, each requiring specific features to be optimized for maximum fitness. The use of self-assembly processes, where a target structure is attained from suitably designed building blocks, is a powerful tool for this optimization. However, it is still an open question how to generally design realizable building blocks that lead to the desired phases. In this work, the double gyroid is chosen as target structure and DNA functionalized nanoparticles are used as our building blocks. Using existing pair potentials as inspiration, a large design space is defined for exploration of the target structure. An effective search strategy is implemented, where free energy calculations are first used to coarse grain our originally fine-grained model of the building blocks and then quickly evaluate the fitness of each design. These data are then fed into a machine learning algorithm that allows obtaining predictions for all candidates in our design space through an active learning loop. Successful coarse-grained designs are identified and evaluated again through interfacial pinning calculations with the fine-grained model. This work leads to the development of specific, experimentally relevant designs of DNA functionalized nanoparticles that self-assembly into the target phase. The methodology used can be extended to other types of building blocks and target structures.",

    "summary": "Despite exhibiting a similar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band character to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates host additional electron pockets that distinguish them from single-band cuprates. The elusive orbital origin of these electron pockets has led to competing theoretical scenarios. Here, using polarization-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we determine the orbital character of the Fermi surfaces in NdNiO$_2$. Our data reveal that the electron-like pocket arises predominantly from interstitial $s$ states, with negligible contributions from rare-earth 5$d$ and 4$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level. The observation of well-defined quantum well states indicates a uniform distribution of these interstitial electrons throughout the film thickness. By comparing with electronic structure of LaNiO$_2$, we find that the rare-earth element modulates the Ni-derived bands and hopping integrals through a chemical pressure effect. These findings clarify the role of rare-earth elements in shaping the low-energy electronic structure and establish the presence of electride-like interstitial $s$ states in a correlated oxide system, where electrons occupy lattice voids rather than atomic orbitals. The electride-like character offer new insight into the self-doping and superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.",

The magnetic and charge configurations in the normal phase of multilayer nickelates which closely relate to the spin-charge fluctuations remain under strongly debated. In this work, we focus the normal-state magnetic, charge and orbital configurations and its evolutions with hydrostatic pressure and Sr-doping concentration of monolayer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$. We reveal that in the ambient pressure tetragonal La2NiO4 displays Neel-type antiferromagnetic order in planer Ni spins with negligible interlayer magnetic coupling; with the increase of pressure, La2NiO4 evolves from insulate into metallic state with the critical pressure about P = 50 GPa; with the substitution of La by Sr, the magnetic ground state evolves from G-type, A-type, to double spin striped antiferromagnetic states, as well as weak charge and orbital orders, at x=1; These results can greatly promote our understanding of the magnetic properties of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, and shed the light of the pairing mechanism of unconventional nickelate superconductors.",

    "summary": "We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g., mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional (2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500 devices, a factor >40$\\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently, fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models, including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination ($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets online.",

    "summary": "In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an \"entangler\" and a \"disentangler\", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.",

In particular, advances of experimental techniques such as cold-atoms measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Fermi-Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction and temperature of the system is changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atoms experiments. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign. Moreover, our specific heat results demonstrate interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime.",

    "summary": "Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this, we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.",

    "summary": "Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has been in the focus of contemporary condensed matter research as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism. In the face of daunting evidence for bulk magnetic order despite promising theoretical predictions, it naturally suggests the focus on thin films where Coulomb interactions are dimensionally quenched and may yield a more strongly correlated environment prone to magnetic ordering. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT), and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to investigate atomically ordered ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) grown on Ru(0001). Contrary to predictions of magnetic order, we observe a nonmagnetic charge density wave (CDW) instability that is driven by Fermi surface nesting within the flat-band surface state, and stabilized by the incommensurate moir\\'e stacking with the substrate. We further identify a nonmagnetic and metastable 2 $\\times$ 2 surface reconstruction that breaks in-plane mirror symmetry and can be reversibly toggled via STM tip manipulation. Our spin-polarized STM measurements find no sign of any magnetic instability at the RuO$_2$ surface. As much as our findings refute proposals for either bulk or surface magnetism in RuO$_2$, we establish ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) as an intriguing platform for exploring Moir\\'e-assisted electronic surface order.",

However, the nature of the various CSC mechanisms and their correlation with underlying crystal symmetries remain unsettled. In this work, we use local spin-sensitive electrochemical potential measurements to directly probe the spatially dependent nonequilibrium spin accumulation in MoTe$_2$ flakes down to four atomic layers. We are able to clearly disentangle contributions originating from the spin Hall and Rashba-Edelstein effects and uncover an abundance of unconventional spin polarizations that develop uniquely in the sample bulk and edges with decreasing thickness. Using ab-initio calculations, we construct a unified understanding of all the observed CSC components in relation to the material dimensionality and stacking arrangement. Our findings not only illuminate previous CSC results on MoTe$_2$ but also have important ramifications for future devices that can exploit the local and layer-dependent spin properties of this 2D topological material.",

In contrast, Green's function-based methods are widely used to compute ionization potentials and electron affinities but have seen limited application to resonances. We integrate the CAP formalism within the $GW$ approximation, enabling the description of electronic resonances in a Green's function framework. This approach entails a fully complex treatment of orbitals and quasiparticle energies in a non-Hermitian setting. We validate our CAP-$GW$ implementation by applying it to the prototypical shape resonances of \\ce{N2^-}, \\ce{CO^-}, \\ce{CO_2^-}, \\ce{C2H2-}, \\ce{C2H4-}, and \\ce{CH2O-}. It offers a fast and practical route to approximate both the lifetimes and positions of resonance states, achieving an accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art wavefunction-based methods.",

    "summary": "The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\\sqrt{3}$$\\times$$\\sqrt{3}$)R30{\\deg} and (2$\\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.",

Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.",

By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.",

    "summary": "The development of materials science is undergoing a shift from empirical approaches to data-driven and algorithm-oriented research paradigm. The state-of-the-art platforms are confined to inorganic crystals, with limited chemical space, sparse experimental data and a lack of integrated online computation for rapid validation. Here, we introduce the Clean Energy Materials Platform (CEMP), an open-access platform that integrates high-throughput computing workflows, multi-scale machine learning (ML) models and a comprehensive materials database tailored for clean energy applications. A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications. CEMP aims to establish a digital ecosystem for clean energy materials, enabling a closed-loop workflow from data acquisition to material discovery and real-time online validation.",

    "summary": "Using the developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling behaviors of the normalized spin current across the interface. Using the 1D Heisenberg chain as a benchmark system, we observe a negative spinon spin current exhibiting algebraic scaling $T^{\\alpha}$, with exponent $\\alpha$, in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence - distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase. It saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit, and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive probes for spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Furthermore, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.",

    "summary": "We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$, formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site, along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and $U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral function exhibits \"Fermi arcs\", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field, aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al. (arXiv:2411.10631).",

In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.",

    "summary": "Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.",

We show that the tensor network simulations can be carried out solely using highly compressed tensor representations of the flow fields and the differential operators and discuss the numerical implementation of the tensor operations required for computing fluid flows in detail. The applicability of our method is demonstrated by applying it to the paradigm example of steady and transient flows around stationary and rotating cylinders. We find excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to finite difference simulations for Strouhal numbers, forces and velocity fields. The properties of our approach are discussed in terms of reduced order models. We estimate the memory saving and potential runtime advantages in comparison to standard finite difference simulations. We find accurate results with errors of less than 0.3% for flow-field compressions by a factor of up to 20 and differential operators compressed by factors of up to 1000 compared to sparse matrix representations. We provide strong numerical evidence that the runtime scaling advantages of the tensor network approach with system size will provide substantial resource savings when simulating larger systems. Finally, we note that, like other tensor network-based fluid flow simulations, our algorithmic framework is directly portable to a quantum computer leading to further scaling advantages.",

    "summary": "Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However, MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \\emph{Tensor Train Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank, linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.",

This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.",

    "summary": "Solving partial differential equations of highly featured problems represents a formidable challenge, where reaching high precision across multiple length scales can require a prohibitive amount of computer memory or computing time. However, the solutions to physics problems typically have structures operating on different length scales, and as a result exhibit a high degree of compressibility. Here, we use the quantics tensor train representation to build a solver for the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that the quantics approach generalizes well to the presence of the non-linear term in the equation. We show that we can resolve phenomena across length scales separated by seven orders of magnitude in one dimension within one hour on a single core in a laptop, greatly surpassing the capabilities of more naive methods. We illustrate our methodology with various modulated optical trap potentials presenting features at vastly different length scales, including solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on two-dimensional grids above a trillion points ($2^{20} \\times 2^{20}$). This quantum-inspired methodology can be readily extended to other partial differential equations combining spatial and temporal evolutions, providing a powerful method to solve highly featured differential equations at unprecedented length scales.",

By evolving the system entirely within a low-rank tensor manifold, the method sidesteps the memory and runtime barriers that limit conventional finite-difference and spectral schemes. Two complementary algorithms are developed: an imaginary-time projector that drives the condensate toward its variational ground state and a rank-adapted fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for real-time dynamics. The framework captures a broad range of physical scenarios - including barrier-confined condensates, quasi-random potentials, long-range dipolar interactions, and multicomponent spinor dynamics - without leaving the compressed representation. Relative to standard discretizations, the QTT approach achieves an exponential reduction in computational resources while retaining quantitative accuracy, thereby extending the practicable regime of Gross-Pitaevskii simulations on classical hardware. These results position tensor networks as a practical bridge between high-performance classical computing and prospective quantum hardware for the numerical treatment of nonlinear Schrodinger-type partial differential equations.",

We show that breaking time-translation symmetry down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin.

This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.",

    "summary": "Correlated electron physics is intrinsically a multiscale problem, since high-energy electronic states screen the interactions between the correlated electrons close to the Fermi level, thereby reducing the magnitude of the interaction strength and dramatically shortening its range. Thus, the handling of screening is an essential ingredient in the first-principles modelling of correlated electron systems. Screening is an intrinsically dynamic process and the corresponding downfolding methods such as the constrained Random Phase Approximation indeed produce a dynamic interaction. However, many low-energy methods require an instantaneous interaction as input, which makes it necessary to map the fully dynamic interaction to an effective instantaneous interaction strength. It is a priori not clear if and when such an effective model can capture the physics of the one with dynamic interaction and how to best perform the mapping. Here, we provide a systematic benchmark relevant to correlated materials, in the form of the Anderson impurity model. Overall, we find that a moment-based approach recently proposed by Scott and Booth performs well. We also identify physical regimes, especially under doping, where an instantaneous interaction cannot capture all of the relevant physics.",

    "summary": "The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\\sqrt{3}$$\\times$$\\sqrt{3}$)R30{\\deg} and (2$\\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.",

    "summary": "The polaron problem is a very old problem in condensed matter physics that dates back to the thirties, but still remain largely unsolved today, especially when electron-electron interaction is taken into consideration. The presence of both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the problem invalidates most existing numerical methods, either computationally too expensive or simply intractable. The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the imaginary-time axis. In this work we present a method based on tensor network and the path integral formalism to solve polaron impurity problems. As both the electron and phonon baths can be integrated out via the Feynman-Vernon influence functional in the path integral formalism, our method is free of bath discretization error. It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and the L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve several long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii) measuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive numerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC. We also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done before to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future method developments.",

    "summary": "This work presents a computational framework for studying reaction dynamics via wavepacket propagation, employing the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method and its multilayer extension (ML-MCTDH) as the core methodologies. The core idea centers on the concept of modes that combine several coordinates along with their hierarchical separations because the degrees of freedom are too numerous to be efficiently treated as a single mode. First, the system is partitioned into several fragments within the same layer, and these fragments are further decomposed. Repeating this process, a hierarchical separation of modes emerges, until modes of a manageable size are achieved. Accordingly, the coordinates frame can be designed hierarchically. Second, the kinetic energy operator (KEO) is derived as a sum-of-products (SOP) of single-particle differential operators through polyspherical approach, while the potential energy surface (PES) is expressed in a similar SOP form of single-particle potentials (SPPs) through (1) reconstruction approaches using an existing PES or (2) direct approaches based on a computed database. Third, the nuclear wave function is expressed in a multi-layer expansion form, where each term is a product of single-particle functions (SPFs) that are further expanded by the SPFs in deeper layer. This expansion form is also adopted by variational eigensolver for electronic wave function. Finally, the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle leads to a set of working equations whose solutions reproduce reaction dynamics. In addition, the hierarchical framework can be rearranged by the mathematical language of tensor network (TN) or tree tensor network (TTN). In this work, we compare the methods represented by function with those in the form of TN or TTN. We also discuss the limitations of the present framework and propose solutions, providing further perspectives.",

Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.",

Using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.",

In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.",

Here, we propose a symmetry-aware, grid-free, transformer-based model, MBFormer, that is designed to learn the entire many-body hierarchy directly from mean-field inputs, exploiting the attention mechanism to accurately capture many-body correlations between mean-field states. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of MBFormer in predicting results based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism, including quasiparticle energies, exciton energies, exciton oscillator strengths, and exciton wavefunction distribution. Our model is trained on a dataset of 721 two-dimensional materials from the C2DB database, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a low prediction mean absolute error (MAE) on the order of 0.1-0.2 eV for state-level quasiparticle and exciton energies across different materials. Moreover, we show explicitly that the attention mechanism plays a crucial role in capturing many-body correlations. Our framework provides an end-to-end platform from ground states to general many-body prediction in real materials, which could serve as a foundation model for computational materials science.",

    "summary": "Multipartite entanglement offers a powerful framework for understanding the complex collective phenomena in quantum many-body systems that are often beyond the description of conventional bipartite entanglement measures. Here, we propose a class of multipartite entanglement measures that incorporate the matrix product state (MPS) representation, enabling the characterization of the optimality of quantum circuits for state preparation. These measures are defined as the minimal distances from a target state to the manifolds of MPSs with specified virtual bond dimensions $\\chi$, and thus are dubbed as $\\chi$-specified matrix product entanglement ($\\chi$-MPE). We demonstrate superlinear, linear, and sublinear scaling behaviors of $\\chi$-MPE with respect to the negative logarithmic fidelity $F$ in state preparation, which correspond to excessive, optimal, and insufficient circuit depth $D$ for preparing $\\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs, respectively. Specifically, a linearly-growing $\\chi$-MPE with $F$ suggests $\\mathcal{H}_{\\chi} \\simeq \\mathcal{H}_{D}$, where $\\mathcal{H}_{\\chi}$ denotes the manifold of the $\\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs and $\\mathcal{H}_{D}$ denotes that of the states accessible by the $D$ layer circuits. We provide an exact proof that $\\mathcal{H}_{\\chi=2} \\equiv \\mathcal{H}_{D=1}$. Our results establish tensor networks as a powerful and general tool for developing parametrized measures of multipartite entanglement. The matrix product form adopted in $\\chi$-MPE can be readily extended to other tensor network ans\\\"atze, whose scaling behaviors are expected to assess the optimality of quantum circuit in preparing the corresponding tensor network states.",

    "summary": "Altermagnets, with spin splitting and vanishing magnetization, have been attributed to many fascinating phenomena and potential applications. In particular, integrating ferroelectricity with altermagnetism to enable magnetoelectric coupling and electric control of spin has drawn significant attention. However, its experimental realization and precise spin manipulation remain elusive. Here, by focusing on molecular ferroelectrics, the first discovered ferroelectrics renowned for their highly controllable molecular polarizations and structural flexibility, we reveal that these obstacles can be removed by an emergent multiferroic altermagnets with tunable spin polarization in a large class of fabricated organic materials. Using a symmetry-based design and a tight-binding model, we uncover the underlying mechanism of such molecular ferroelectric altermagnets and demonstrate how noncollinear molecular polarization can switch the spin polarization on and off and even reverse its sign. From the first-principles calculations, we verify the feasibility of these materials in a series of well-established hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and metal-organic frameworks. Our findings bridge molecular ferroelectrics and altermagnetic spintronics, highlighting an unexplored potential of multifunctional organic multiferroics.",

Focusing on the systems with higher hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL is beneficial to the global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the picture that the IL itself can drive the $d$-wave superconductivity while the OLs only serve as the charge reservoir. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.",

This 'reverse engineering approach' leads to $|M_q|^2 \\sim \\frac{1}{q^2+\\xi(T)^{-2}}$. We comment how can such exotic coupling emerge in 2D systems where short range magnetic fluctuations resides. In other words, the role of quantum criticality is found to be crucial. And the T-linear behaviour of resistivity demands that the magnetic correlation length scales as $\\xi(T)\\propto\\frac{1}{T}$, which seems to be a reasonable assumption in the quantum critical regime of cuprates (that is, near optimal doping where T-linear resistivity is observed).",

This computational obstacle limits the potential of the technique as it precludes the reconstruction of physically interesting highly-strained particles. Here, we propose a novel approach to this problem using a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on 3D simulated diffraction data to predict the corresponding reciprocal space phase. This method allows to fully exploit the potential of the CNN by mapping functions within the same space and leveraging structural similarities between input and output. The final object is obtained by the inverse Fourier transform of the retrieved complex diffracted amplitude and is then further refined with iterative algorithms.

Our semiclassical Monte Carlo calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials. This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that when the on-site repulsive Hubbard interaction strength is set to zero on a percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably, this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.",

    "summary": "The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics. It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a system responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property. Applications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To prove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry property, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of certain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS relation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation contains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size. Non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed recently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as usual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we argue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a Heisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational capacity, indirectly support the larger correction. This work helps extend into nonequilibrium physics the effort, recently of interest across quantum physics, to identify how non-Abelian symmetries may alter conventional thermodynamics.",

    "summary": "Quantum phase transitions between topologically ordered and symmetry-broken phases lie beyond Landau theory. A prime example is the conjectured continuous transition from the bosonic $\\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state to a superfluid, proposed to be governed by a QED$_3$--Chern--Simons (CS) critical point whose stability remains uncertain. We study half-filled bosons in the lowest Landau level subject to a lattice potential. Infinite-cylinder DMRG reveals a single continuous Laughlin--to--superfluid transition. Adiabatic flux insertion collapses the many-body gap and exposes massless Dirac quasiparticles, while momentum-resolved correlation lengths show that three lattice-related density modes share the same critical exponent, evidencing an emergent $SO(3)$ symmetry. The joint appearance of Dirac dispersion and symmetry enlargement provides microscopic support for a stable QED$_3$--CS fixed point. Our numerical strategy also offers a blueprint for exploring Landau-forbidden transitions in fractional Chern insulators and composite Fermi liquids realised in moire and cold-atom systems.",

    "summary": "A quantum state of matter that is forbidden to interact with photons and is therefore undetectable by spectroscopic means is called a dark state. This basic concept can be applied to condensed matter where it suggests that a whole band of quantum states could be undetectable across a full Brillouin zone. Here we report the discovery of such condensed matter dark states in palladium diselenide as a model system that has two pairs of sublattices in the primitive cell. By using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find valence bands that are practically unobservable over the whole Brillouin zone at any photon energy, polarisation, and scattering plane. Our model shows that two pairs of sublattices located at half-translation positions and related by multiple glide-mirror symmetries make their relative quantum phases polarised into only four kinds, three of which become dark due to double destructive interference. This mechanism is generic to other systems with two pairs of sublattices, and we show how the phenomena observed in cuprates, lead-halide perovskites, and density wave systems can be resolved by the mechanism of dark states. Our results suggest that the sublattice degree of freedom, which has been overlooked so far, should be considered in the study of correlated phenomena and optoelectronic characteristics.",

In one dimension, the so-called infrared divergence prevents us from calculating any -- whether static or dynamic -- structure factor within the conventional spin-wave theory even at zero temperature. The well-known modified spin-wave theory initiated by Takahashi completely fails to treat anharmonicities to cause transverse-to-longitudinal coupling which are quite characteristic of noncollinear antiferromagnets. We propose imposing a double-constraint condition on spin waves to solve all these difficulties and get a full view of the nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in one-dimensional frustrated noncollinear antiferromagnets. We reveal a novel instability of the single-particle spectrum in the absence of any well-defined magnetically ordered ground state.",

For this task, here we introduce a \\textit{tangent-space excitation ansatz} for quantum circuits, motivated by the quasi-particle picture of many-body systems and the structural similarity between quantum circuits and classical tensor networks. Increasing the circuit depth by one layer to construct the tangent space around the variational optimum of a parametrized quantum circuit, we show that a large number of low-energy states can be accurately captured. We demonstrate this ansatz using various models in both one and two spatial dimensions, including the challenging kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We further provide evidence that this approach, implementable using Hadamard test, is stable in the presence of measurement noise and scalable to large system size.",

    "summary": "We explore topological electronic structure of magnetic phases in a multi-orbital Hubbard model with spin-orbit interactions. To account for more general antiferromagnetic orders that go beyond the collinear N\\'eel order, two different spin-orbit interactions, Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions, are considered. By performing the canonical transformation, we derive the corresponding generalized t-J model. At half filling, employing self-consistent magnetic order calculations, we find distinctive spin arrangements under Dresselhaus or Rashba spin-orbit interactions. For the Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, the spin configuration exhibits collinear antiferromagnetic order. On the other hand, Rashba interaction results in spins antiferromagnetically aligning in xy-plane and a small interaction controlled by hopping parameter induces spin tilting, causing antiferromagnetic alignment in xy-plane but ferromagnetic alignment in z-direction. We categorize topological properties of these phases for low doping in the generalized t-J model.: for 3D collinear antiferromagnetic order, the system possesses a modified time-reversal symmetry, characterized by the Z2 index. In contrast, for systems with tilted antiferromagnetic orders, it is protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by the Z4 index. We further examine the bulk-edge correspondence for non-collinear magnetic phases, revealing that the surface state becomes gapless when the surface is parallel to the ferromagnetic component of tilted antiferromagnetic order; otherwise, the surface state exhibits a gap. Our findings offer a comprehensive topological characterization for doped and canted antiferromagnetic insulators with spin-orbit interactions, providing valuable insights into the interplay between spin arrangements, symmetries, and topological properties in systems governed by the multi-orbital Hubbard model.",

    "summary": "We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ans\\\"atze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recent progress has shown that a broad class of highly correlated wavefunctions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries.

However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models, general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process. While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the coming years.",

    "summary": "Recent experimental study on Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ superconductors has revealed an unexpected quantum phase transition from superconducting state to insulatinglike state under pressure [Zhou et al., Nat. Phys. 18, 406 (2022)]. To better understand the physical origin of this pressure-induced phenomenon, here we have studied the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of undoped and O-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212) under pressures based on density-functional theory calculations. We first identified the crystal structure of undoped Bi2212 with the armchair distortions in the BiO layers and reproduced the insulating feature of the parent compound. Then we added an extra O atom to the parent compound to simulate the hole-doping effect and found that the structure with O dopant located in the van der Waals (vdW) gap is energetically the most stable. Further calculations on O-doped (0.125 holes/Cu) Bi2212 revealed that the pressure can induce charge redistributions between CuO$_2$ planes and BiO layers; specifically, Cu-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals gain electrons and Cu atoms rather than O atoms dominate around the Fermi level under high pressure. Along with the increasing pressure, the density of states at the Fermi level first reaches the maximum at $\\sim$ 10 GPa and then shows a valley near the Fermi level above 20 GPa, which may be responsible for the insulatinglike state observed in recent experiments. We suggest that the competition among several factors, such as the increase of electrons in the CuO$_2$ plane, the variation of in-plane hopping due to the shortened Cu-O distance, and the enhanced Coulomb repulsion among the Cu-3$d$ electrons, could lead to the exotic transition under pressure. Our work provides an explanation of the high-pressure behaviors of Bi2212, which may facilitate a comprehensive understanding of cuprate superconductors.",

    "summary": "Quantum algorithms for estimating the ground state energy of a quantum system often operate by preparing a classically accessible quantum state and then applying quantum phase estimation. Whether this approach yields quantum advantage hinges on the state's energy spectrum, that is, the sequence of the state's overlaps with the energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian. For any entanglement-compressed quantum state with minimal expected energy, it is shown that its energy spectrum decays at most with the inverse-squared energy eigenvalues. This explains the main empirical finding of Silvester, Carleo, and White (Physical Review Letters, 2025) that the energy spectra of matrix product states do not decay exponentially. It also reduces the question of quantum advantage to the energy and entanglement profile of the Hamiltonian's eigenstates.",

    "summary": "Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\\bot}$ in a large doping range $\\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\\rm SC} \\sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.",

For spin-1/2 KAFH, our best per-site ground-state energy estimate reaches -0.417J, and after applying open-boundary corrections, it closely approaches the established thermodynamic value of -0.438J. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid approach that splits the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. We further introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining physical accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices.",

While its efficacy has been demonstrated in the homogeneous systems theoretically, most experimental setups feature a confining potential, such as a harmonic trap, which complicates the practical implementations. In this work, we experimentally probe the quench spectroscopy for one-dimensional bosons in optical lattices with the presence of a harmonic trap, and comparing our results with the density matrix renormalization group simulation. For the Mott insulator phase, although a gap is still observed, the band signal is broadened along the frequency space and cut at the half Brillouin zone, which can be explained by the excitations under harmonic confinement. Comparing with the superfluid spectrum, we can see a clear distinction between the two phases and find the inverse quench with larger amplitude yields the clearest spectrum. Our work offers pivotal insights into conducting quench spectroscopy effectively in practical systems.",

    "summary": "Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable moire potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before a metallic state forms. A chiral $f+if$ superconductor and a commensurate $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) differ in energy by less than $1\\%$, reproducing the distinct superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases experimentally observed near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome remains robust against realistic Coulomb screening, light doping, and variations in lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.",

    "summary": "A key to understand how electrons behave in crystalline solids is the band structure that connects the energy of electron waves to their wavenumber (k). Even in the phase of matter with only short-range order (liquid or amorphous solid), the coherent part of electron waves still possesses a band structure. Theoretical models for the band structure of liquid metals were formulated more than 5 decades ago, but thus far, bandstructure renormalization and pseudogap induced by resonance scattering have remained unobserved. Here, we report the observation of this unusual band structure at the interface of a crystalline insulator (black phosphorus) and disordered dopants (alkali metals). We find that a conventional parabolic band structure of free electrons bends back towards zero k with the pseudogap of 30-240 meV from the Fermi level. This is k renormalization caused by resonance scattering that leads to the formation of quasi-bound states in the scattering potential of alkali-metal ions. The depth of this potential tuned by different kinds of alkali metal (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) allows to classify the pseudogap of p-wave and d-wave resonance. Our results may provide a clue to the puzzling spectrum of various crystalline insulators doped by disordered dopants, such as the waterfall dispersion in cuprates.",

    "summary": "The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bulk $\\mathrm{La}_{3}\\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{7}$ has ignited significant interest in nickelate superconductors. Unlike cuprates, where superconductivity predominantly originates from the $\\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, nickelates exhibit additional complexities involving contributions from the $\\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$ orbital, prompting fundamental questions about their pairing mechanisms. Despite recent progress in stabilizing superconductivity in $\\mathrm{La}_{3}\\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films at ambient pressure, direct spectroscopic evidence of the superconducting gap opening remains elusive. Here, we present an in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of Sr-doped superconducting $\\mathrm{La}_{3}\\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films. Fermi surface mapping reveals Ni-$\\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-derived $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ pockets, with orbital fillings of 0.11$\\pm$0.02 electrons and 0.66$\\pm$0.03 holes per Ni, respectively, resulting in a total of 0.45$\\pm$0.04 electrons for each Ni. These bands exhibit moderate electron correlations, characterized by a band renormalization factor of 3-4. Notably, both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ bands exhibit leading-edge shifts across the superconducting transition, with gap magnitude of ~1-2 meV at Fermi momenta along the Brillouin zone diagonal and slightly away from the zone diagonal, deviating from the conventional $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap structure. Additionally, the Ni-$\\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$-derived $\\gamma$ band lies ~75 meV below the Fermi level, indicating a $\\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-dominated fermiology in this compound.",

Half-integer $\\kappa/\\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the experimentally observed value of $\\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian' state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an 'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can \"screen'' a Pfaffian or AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from those of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is consistent with experiment.",

In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.",

Integrating these simulations with the PDynA analysis toolkit, we resolve both equilibrium phase diagrams and dynamic structural evolution under varying temperature and halide-mixing conditions. Our findings reveal that the A-site cation strongly modulates octahedral tilt modes and phase pathways: MA$^+$ effectively \"forbids\" the beta-to-gamma transition in MAPbX$_3$ by requiring extensive molecular rearrangements and crystal rotation, whereas the debated low-temperature phase in FAPbX$_3$ is best represented as an Im$\\bar{3}$ cubic phase with $a^+a^+a^+$ tilts. Additionally, small changes in halide composition and arrangement $\\unicode{x2013}$ from uniform mixing to partial segregation $\\unicode{x2013}$ alter tilt correlations. Segregated domains can even foster anomalous tilting modes that impede uniform phase transformations. These results highlight the multi-scale interplay between cation environment and halide distribution, offering a rational basis for tuning perovskite architectures toward improved phase stability.",

    "summary": "The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.",

    "summary": "Abinit is a widely used scientific software package implementing density functional theory and many related functionalities for excited states and response properties. This paper presents the novel features and capabilities, both technical and scientific, which have been implemented over the past 5 years. This evolution occurred in the context of evolving hardware platforms, high-throughput calculation campaigns, and the growing use of machine learning to predict properties based on databases of first principles results. We present new methodologies for ground states with constrained charge, spin or temperature; for density functional perturbation theory extensions to flexoelectricity and polarons; and for excited states in many-body frameworks including GW, dynamical mean field theory, and coupled cluster. Technical advances have extended abinit high-performance execution to graphical processing units and intensive parallelism. Second principles methods build effective models on top of first principles results to scale up in length and time scales. Finally, workflows have been developed in different community frameworks to automate \\abinit calculations and enable users to simulate hundreds or thousands of materials in controlled and reproducible conditions.",

Here, we introduce an alternative isometric form for isoTPS by incorporating auxiliary tensors to represent the orthogonality hypersurface. We implement the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on this new isometric form and benchmark the method by computing ground states and the real time evolution of the transverse field Ising model in two dimensions on large square lattices of up to 1250 sites. Our results demonstrate that isoTPS can efficiently capture the entanglement structure of two-dimensional area law states. The short-time dynamics is also accurately reproduced even at the critical point. Our isoTPS formulation further allows for a natural extension to different lattice geometries, such as the honeycomb or kagome latice.",

We study the hole-doped model, identifying a transition from magnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the strong-coupling regime. Our findings offer a qualitatively new ground state picture.

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.",

In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.",

    "summary": "Glassy solid electrolytes (GSEs), with their amorphous nature and the absence of grain boundaries, make them highly attractive for applications in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), a leading candidate for next-generation energy storage technologies. A recently developed lithium thioborophosphate iodide GSE, composed of 30Li$_2$S-25B$_2$S$_3$-45LiI-5P$_2$S$_5$ (LBPSI), has demonstrated excellent room-temperature ionic conductivity and low activation energy. Despite this exciting finding, the underlying mechanism behind this ultrafast ion transport remains ambiguous. Here, we accurately fine-tune the foundational MACE-MP-0 model and perform large-scale machine learning molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural and ion dynamics in LBPSI GSE. Our results reveal that B$_2$S$_3$ glass formers primarily form multi-bridged B$_x$S$_y$ long-chain networks that impede Li$^+$ conduction. In contrast, P$_2$S$_5$ gives rise to mono-tetrahedral PS$_4$$^{3-}$ and di-tetrahedral P$_2$S$_7$$^{4-}$ tetrahedra, which engage in distinctive corner-sharing modes with BS$_4$$^{5-}$ tetrahedra, effectively disrupting the B$_x$S$_y$ chains and enhancing Li$^+$ mobility. Furthermore, the polyhedral anion rotations of PS$_4$$^{3-}$ and BS$_4$$^{5-}$ in the corner-sharing PS$_4$-BS$_4$ motifs may further promote fast Li$^+$ conduction.",

    "summary": "Discrete fermionic and bosonic models for hyperbolic lattices have attracted significant attention across a range of fields since the experimental realization of hyperbolic lattices in metamaterial platforms, sparking the development of hyperbolic crystallography. However, a fundamental and experimentally consequential aspect remains unaddressed: fermions propagating in curved space inherently couple to the underlying geometry via the spin connection, as required by general covariance - a feature not yet incorporated in studies of hyperbolic crystals. Here, we introduce a symmetry-based framework for Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic lattices, explicitly incorporating spin-curvature coupling via a discrete spin connection. Starting from the continuous symmetries of the Poincar\\'e disk, we classify the irreducible representations and construct a symmetry-adapted basis, establishing a direct correspondence to the continuum Dirac theory. We show that this continuum theory predicts a finite density of states at zero energy for any finite curvature in $D-$dimensional hyperbolic space with $2\\leq D \\leq 4$, suggesting enhanced susceptibility of Dirac fermions to interaction-driven instabilities at weak coupling. We then derive explicit forms of discrete translational and rotational symmetries for lattices characterized by Schl\\\"afli symbols $\\{p,q\\}$, and explicitly construct the discrete spin connection, represented as hopping phases, via parallel transport. Our results pave the way for experimental realization of spin-curvature effects in metamaterial platforms and systematic numerical studies of correlated Dirac phases in hyperbolic geometries.",

As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\\\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.",

    "summary": "Understanding the confinement mechanism in gauge theories and the universality of effective string-like descriptions of gauge flux tubes remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. We probe string modes of motion with dynamical matter in a digital quantum simulation of a (2+1) dimensional gauge theory using a superconducting quantum processor with up to 144 qubits, stretching the hardware capabilities with quantum-circuit depths comprising up to 192 two-qubit layers. We realize the $Z_2$-Higgs model ($Z_2$HM) through an optimized embedding into a heavy-hex superconducting qubit architecture, directly mapping matter and gauge fields to vertex and link superconducting qubits, respectively. Using the structure of local gauge symmetries, we implement a comprehensive suite of error suppression, mitigation, and correction strategies to enable real-time observation and manipulation of electric strings connecting dynamical charges. Our results resolve a dynamical hierarchy of longitudinal oscillations and transverse bending at the end points of the string, which are precursors to hadronization and rotational spectra of mesons. We further explore multi-string processes, observing the fragmentation and recombination of strings. The experimental design supports 300,000 measurement shots per circuit, totaling 600,000 shots per time step, enabling high-fidelity statistics. We employ extensive tensor network simulations using the basis update and Galerkin method to predict large-scale real-time dynamics and validate our error-aware protocols. This work establishes a milestone for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics via superconducting quantum simulation and elucidates the real-time behavior of confining strings.",

We propose a framework to compute Greeks in a single evaluation of a tensor train (TT), which is obtained by compressing the Fourier transform (FT)-based pricing function via TT learning using tensor cross interpolation. Based on this TT representation, we introduce two approaches to compute Greeks: a numerical differentiation (ND) approach that applies a numerical differential operator to one tensor core and an analytical (AN) approach that constructs the TT of closed-form differentiation expressions of FT-based pricing. Numerical experiments on a five-asset min-call option in the Black-Sholes model show significant speed-ups of up to about $10^{5} \\times$ over MC while maintaining comparable accuracy. The ND approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of the AN approach and requires lower computational complexity for constructing the TT representation, making it the preferred choice.",

Our calculation reveals dramatically different material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain negligible in Si, they become increasingly important in MgO and dominant in BaO near its melting point, where they surpass three- and four-phonon scattering intensity and significantly reduce lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from softened harmonic interactions. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials and at elevated temperatures.",

    "summary": "Empirical rate-and-state friction laws are widely used in geophysics and engineering to simulate interface slip. They postulate that the friction coefficient depends on the local slip rate and a state variable that reflects the history of slip. Depending on the parameters, rate-and-state friction can be either rate-strengthening, leading to steady slip, or rate-weakening, leading to unsteady stick-slip behavior modeling earthquakes. Rate-and-state friction does not have a potential or variational formulation, making implicit solution approaches difficult and implementation numerically expensive. In this work, we propose a potential formulation for the rate-and-state friction. We formulate the potentials as neural networks and train them so that the resulting behavior emulates the empirical rate-and-state friction. We show that this potential formulation enables implicit time discretization leading to efficient numerical implementation.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in machine learning have enabled large-scale atomic simulations with first-principles accuracy, allowing precise modeling of disordered materials such as glassy carbon (GC). However, conventional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) cannot effectively capture anisotropic stress effects, which are believed to play a key role in the transformation of GC into amorphous diamond under extreme conditions. In this work, we present an on-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD (ML-augmented CAIMD) approach by modifying VASP 6.3.2. Our simulations not only reproduce major experimental features of GC but also provide restrictive synthesis conditions and microscopic insights. We show that GC exhibits unexpectedly high plasticity, with its compressive and shear strengths enhanced by large strains. Under pressure, increasing annealing temperature promotes the formation of quenchable amorphous diamond via enhanced sp3 preservation, but this trend reverses above 2900 K due to thermal graphitization. Under non-hydrostatic compression, GC transforms into a superhard structure sustaining large stress differences, which sharply increase when confining pressure exceeds 40 GPa. Finally, severe rotational shear at 30 GPa induces sp3 fractions up to 80 percent at 300 to 1000 K. A hardened amorphous carbon retaining 64 percent sp3 content is achieved by decompression at 300 K, marking the lowest pressure-temperature route ever predicted. Our ML-augmented CAIMD provides a general framework for modeling structural transformations in disordered materials under anisotropic stresses.",

    "summary": "High entropy alloys (HEAs) offer unprecedented compositional flexibility for designing advanced materials, yet predicting their crystallographic phases remains a key bottleneck due to limited data and complex phase formation behavior. Here, we present a quantum-enhanced machine learning framework that leverages quantum annealing to enhance phase classification in HEAs. Our pipeline integrates Quantum Boosting (QBoost) for interpretable feature selection and classification, with Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) that use quantum-enhanced kernels to capture nonlinear relationships between physical descriptors. By reformulating both models as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, we exploit the efficient sampling capabilities of quantum annealers to achieve rapid training and robust generalization, demonstrating notable runtime reductions relative to classical baselines in our setup. We target six key phases: FCC, BCC, Sigma, Laves, Heusler, and AlXY B2, and benchmark model performance using both cross-validation and a rigorously curated test set of prior experimentally synthesized HEAs. The results confirm strong alignment between predicted and measured phases. Our findings demonstrate that quantum-enhanced classifiers match or exceed classical models in accuracy and offer insights grounded in interpretable physical descriptors. This work constitutes an important step toward practical quantum acceleration in materials discovery pipelines.",

    "summary": "The sublattice current is recently proposed as a feasible scheme to realize the odd-parity altermagnetism(ALM) by breaking the nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry. We first adopt the spin group method to analyze why the broken nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS) is the sufficient condition for the odd-parity ALM, and find that it is the symmetry $[\\bar{C}_2||\\bar{E}]$ that allows the appearance of the odd-parity ALM where $\\bar{C}_2$ represents a $180^\\circ$ rotation around an axis perpendicular to the spins combined with the spin-space inversion, and $\\bar{E}$ is the inversion in real space. As a representative example with the presence of sublattice currents, the optical conductivity of Haldane-Hubbard model is further studied using the Kubo formula. It is shown that there is no spin-polarized electrical current in both the longitudinal and traverse directions because of TRS in the odd-parity ALM, and they display a significant peak in the vicinity of the single-particle direct energy gap which reflects that both the longitudinal and traverse optical conductivities are dominated by the quasiparticle excitations around the Dirac points. We also study the hole doping dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity $\\sigma_{\\rm Hall}$ as well as the staggered magnetization $M$, and find that they display opposite behaviors, i.e., $\\sigma_{\\rm Hall}$ in the ALM CI state is diminished monotonically from its initial value $C=2$ at half-filling as the hole doping is increased, while in the ALMI state exhibits a non-monotonous behavior.",

The electronic phases include partially charge-ordered metal or insulator, and fully charge-ordered insulator. The different magnetic phases of the model are non-magnet, spin density wave, spin split compensated ferrimagnet or partial antiferromagnet. Analysis of the electronic band structure reveals that the partially charge-ordered compensated ferrimagnetic phase exhibits spin polarisation, which can be quite interesting for spintronics applications. We also compute the polarisation as a function of $U$ using the Berry phase formalism and show that the system exhibits multiferroicity with coexisting compensated ferrimagnetic spin order alongside electronic polarisations.",

While ab initio molecular dynamics methods are highly accurate, they are limited by short accessible time and length scales whereas classical force fields struggle with accuracy. Herein, we explore the structure and thermodynamics of complex monovalent-divalent ion pairs using Na2SO4(aq) as a case study by applying a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Our MLIP-based approach reproduces key bulk properties such as density and radial distribution functions of water. We provide the hydration structure of the sodium and sulfate ions in 0.1-2 M concentration range and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional potentials of mean force for the sodium-sulfate ion pairing at the low concentration limit (0.1 M) which are inaccessible to DFT. At low concentrations, the sulfate ion is strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion pairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that coordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby the sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially. We demonstrate that MLIPs allow the study of solvated ions beyond simple monovalent pairs with DFT-level accuracy in their low concentration limit (0.1 M) via statistically converged properties from ns long simulations.",

In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.",

    "summary": "Motivated by recent experimental advancements in scanning optical stroboscopic confocal microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, which have facilitated exceptional energy-space-time resolution for investigating edge and bulk dynamics in fractional quantum Hall systems, we formulated a model for the pump-probe process on the edge. Starting with a ground state, we applied a tip potential near the fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, which was subsequently turned off after a defined time duration. By examining how the specific nature of the tip potential influences the evolution of the wave function and its distribution in energy spectrum, we identify that quench dynamics of the edge pulse leads to excitations that spread both along the edge and perpendicularly into the bulk. Moreover, magnetoroton excitations are predominant among the bulk excitations. These results align well with the experimental observations. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of the tip's position, intensity, and duration on the dynamics.",

This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large, exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.",

Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA) is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D lattice.",

    "summary": "Tensor Network (TN) decompositions have emerged as an indispensable tool in Big Data analytics owing to their ability to provide compact low-rank representations, thus alleviating the ``Curse of Dimensionality'' inherent in handling higher-order data. At the heart of their success lies the concept of TN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions. However, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an intuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across different TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as empirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters inferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to demystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks through real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by illustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in widely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker decompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory graphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a perspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the corresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing cumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN design. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear and unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary physical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and deployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational contexts.",

The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.",

    "summary": "Quantum phase transitions are typically marked by changes in quantum correlations across various spatial scales within the system. A key challenge lies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal quantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be insufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as superconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations, we show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations, occupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of off-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of the superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of particle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While this symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it allows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal correlations.",

Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E, defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\\Delta = 2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality. These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical investigation into the foundations of emergent space.",

As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\\\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.",

    "summary": "Motivated by recent developments in the study of quasi-one-dimensional iron systems with Fe$^{2+}$, we comprehensively study the Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide chain system. Based on first-principles calculations, the Fe$^{3+}$ chain has a similar electronic structure as discussed before in the iron 2+ chain, due to similar Fe$X_4$ ($X$ = S or Se) tetrahedron chain geometry. Furthermore, a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth). Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$ chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems. Our results establish with clarity the similarities and differences between Fe$^{2+}$and Fe$^{3+}$ iron chains, as well as iron ladders.",

Additionally, how the doped holes in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ are distributed among different orbitals remain unresolved. Motivated by recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we theoretically study the electronic structure of infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at various doping levels. We find that, unlike the expectation from a rigid band shift, holes are equally distributed to Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and interstitial-$s$ orbitals. The role of interstitial-$s$ orbital is further confirmed from the renormalization of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, for which the coupling between interstitial-$s$ and Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ exerts a non-negligible impact on the orbital-selective renormalization observed in ARPES. We also discuss the implication of our results to the single-band model, where the interstitial-$s$ orbital in the normal state of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ acts as charge donator enhancing the correlation of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ by increasing its concentration close to half-filling.",

Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.",

The general strategy is to break the inversion symmetry of conventional antiferromagnets or the rotational/mirror symmetry of altermagnets to achieve fully-compensated ferrimagnets. Here, we propose to induce fully-compensated ferrimagnetism by engineering the spin ordering rather than modifying the lattice structure. Bilayer stacking engineering offers a convenient platform to verify our proposal and readily enables switching between two distinct electronic states by tuning the $\\mathrm{N\\acute{e}el}$ vector of one layer. By the first-principles calculations, a bilayer system is constructed with monolayer $\\mathrm{Cr_2C_2S_6}$ as the elementary building block to corroborate our proposal. This strategy can also be extended to inducing altermagnetism via spin ordering engineering. Our work offers an alternative route to realize non-relativistic spin splitting in zero-net-magnetization magnets, paving the way for the advancement and construction of low-power spintronic device.",

    "summary": "We introduce the concept of natural super-orbitals for many-body operators, defined as the eigenvectors of the one-body super-density matrix associated with a vectorized operator. We first analyze the general analytical properties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact matrix-product-operator representation in the natural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time scales.",

    "summary": "The classical outer optimisation loop of the classical-quantum hybrid Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) can be bypassed by transferring precomputed parameters to larger unseen problem instances using the parameter concentration property found in certain classes of problem instances. In this paper, parameter transfer is applied to the recursive-QAOA (RQAOA) approach of Bravyi et al. implementing the Binary Paint Shop Problem (BPSP) -- an optimisation problem found in manufacturing where a sequence of cars are to be painted under certain constraints while minimising the number of colour changes between cars. The BPSP can be conveniently formulated as an Ising ground state problem with a symmetric Hamiltonian and Ising graph structure that is well-suited for QAOA parameter-transfer techniques. Throughout our quantum simulated experiments, parameter transfer showed no noticeable reduction in solution quality over optimisation for QAOA and RQAOA while substantially improving the efficiency due to avoiding measurements required for optimisation. Additionally, RQAOA only requires measurements of $ZZ$-correlations instead of full statevectors, benefiting from the reverse-causal-cone feature that leads to circuits with significantly lower CNOT counts and depths. The performance of QAOA and RQAOA with parameter transfer is benchmarked against classical solvers and heuristics and their resilience to non-optimal parameters is explored. The entanglement entropy and bond dimensions are obtained from matrix product state simulations to provide an indication of the classical resources required to simulate the quantum algorithms. Circuit sizes and measurement counts are compared between the implementations.",

Recently, neural quantum states have emerged as a promising approach for studying correlated fermions, highlighted by the hidden fermion and backflow methods, which use neural networks to model corrections to fermionic quasiparticle orbitals. In this work, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that naturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion Pfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and superconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic complexity. In our numerical experiments, HFPS provides state-of-the-art variational accuracy in different regimes of both the attractive and repulsive Hubbard models. We show that the HFPS is able to capture both s-wave and d-wave pairing, and therefore may be a useful tool for modeling phases with unconventional superconductivity.",

    "summary": "Quantum dots (QDs) exhibit unique properties arising from their reduced size and quantum confinement effects, including exceptionally bright and tunable photoluminescence. Among these, CuInS$_{2}$ QDs have gained significant attention owing to their remarkable broadband emission, making them highly desirable for various optoelectronic applications requiring efficient luminescent nanomaterials. However, maximizing radiative recombination in CuInS$_{2}$ QDs often necessitates minimizing intragap trap states. A common approach involves the introduction of Zn during the synthesis, which typically promotes the formation of a ZnS shell that passivates the QD surface.   Despite its importance, the characterization and quantification of Zn incorporation using conventional techniques, such as optical spectroscopy or electron microscopy, remains challenging. In this study, we utilized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in both X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectral ranges, to investigate Zn incorporation into CuInS$_{2}$ QDs with element-specific precision. This approach allowed us to detect the formation of a ZnS surface shell and to resolve the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD lattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent, or as an interstitial defect.   Additionally, we explored the optical and dynamical properties of CuInS$_{2}$ QDs using time-resolved optical spectroscopies, particularly in the presence of electron and hole acceptors. These results provide deeper insights into the role and effectiveness of the Zn-induced passivating layer, paving the way for optimizing QD performance in photoluminescence applications.",

Measured data were analyzed by several approaches including atomic, crystal-field theory and the Anderson impurity model to take into account the hybridization of actinide valence states with oxygen $2p$ states. For Th(IV), the $5f$ states are mainly affected by the crystal-field interaction with the closest neighbors as can be seen from the corresponding spectrum of ThO$_2$. In turn, for U(VI) and U(V) oxides, the U $5f$-O $2p$ hybridization and high degree of covalency in the chemical bonding play a decisive role increasing the $5f$ occupancy and consequently governing the ground and excited state properties. That is additionally illustrated by results from the calculations of the U $5d$ x-ray photoemission spectra for U(V) in the lattice of La-doped UO$_2$.",

This quantics tensor train diagnostics approach allows us to i) identify quantum phase transitions (ground state crossings) and thermal crossovers, ii) distinguish between these two by allowing flexibility through iii) using arbitrary available correlators and iv) the possibility to deal with low-accuracy input data through varying the quantics tensor train cutoffs. We verify the validity of the approach by studying the phase diagram of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. We find time scale entanglement to be a system-inherent property becoming maximal at phase transitions and crossover, which translates to peaks in the quantics tensor train bond dimension of correlator functions. Additionally, the connection of the method to other physical quantities, such as various entanglement measures and susceptibilities, is shown.",

Conventional cuprates typically contain perfect CuO$_2$ planes which are considered as a key factor to superconductivity since the superconductivity takes place in them. However, in Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\\delta}$ with $\\delta=0.2$ and O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes, superconductivity still arises even with a transition temperature as high as 73 K. Using combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we investigated the electronic correlation and electronic structure of Ba$_2$CuO$_{3.25}$ with alternating quasi-one-dimensional (1D) CuO planes and O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes. We find that although different from the usual cuprates, the Cu atoms are still dominated by a 3$d^9$ configuration and the system is of a new kind of correlated single-orbital physics. The quasi-1D CuO planes, composed of parallel Cu-O chains, are slightly hole-doped quasi-1D Mott insulator, while the O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes are more hole doped, with a 2D correlated electronic structure, and may host superconductivity.",

We also show that to order $1/S^2$ the ground state energy is not sensitive to the component of the interaction which is responsible for altermagnetism. At the $\\Gamma$-point the $1/S$-correction to the magnon dispersion vanishes so that quantum fluctuations do not induce a gap in the magnon spectrum of altermagnets, as expected by Goldstone's theorem. We extract the leading $1/S$-corrections to the spin-wave velocity and the effective mass characterizing the curvature of the magnon dispersion in altermagnets.",

We then use our approach as impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to address the case of a two-orbital, realistic layered structure, recovering the strong crystal-field-driven charge polarization observed by solving the DMFT self-consistent cycle with QMC, albeit slightly reduced. Finally, we address a prototype nonequilibrium setup by sandwiching this layer between metallic contacts subject to a bias voltage described by different chemical potentials. This simplified model demonstrates out method's potential to access nonequilibrium steady-state behavior of multi-orbital, realistic materials. These findings provide a first-step basis for theoretical studies of nonequilibrium properties of multi-orbital compounds directly in the real frequency domain.",

We then employ a generalized version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the circuit. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths.

    "summary": "A central challenge for understanding unconventional superconductivity in most strongly correlated electronic materials is their complicated band structure and presence of competing orders. In contrast, quasi-two-dimensional organic spin liquids are single-band systems with superconductivity arising near the bandwidth-tuned Mott metal-insulator transition in the absence of other orders. Here, we study chemically substituted $\\kappa$-organics in which superconducting fluctuations emerge in the phase coexistence region between the Mott insulator and the Fermi liquid. Using magnetotransport and ac susceptibility measurements, we find that global superconductivity fails to set in as temperature $T\\rightarrow 0$. Our results indicate instead the presence of superconducting domains embedded in the metallic percolating cluster that undergo a magnetic field-tuned quantum superconductor-to-metal phase transition. Surprisingly, albeit consistent with the percolation picture, universal conductance fluctuations are seen at high fields in macroscopic samples. The observed interplay of the intrinsic inhomogeneity and quantum phase fluctuations provides a new insight into failed superconductivity, a phenomenon seen in various conventional and unconventional superconductors, including cuprates.",

    "summary": "We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$, formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site, along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and $U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral function exhibits \"Fermi arcs\", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field, aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al. (arXiv:2411.10631).",

    "summary": "Bilayer nickelates exhibit high-temperature superconductivity under proper hydrostatic pressure or epitaxial strain, signifying the emergence of quantum phase transitions whose physical mechanisms remain unclear. Using a minimal bilayer Hubbard model incorporating only the essential Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, we demonstrate that a phase transition naturally arises from tuning the ratio of intralayer to interlayer hopping amplitudes. The transition point separates regimes with a rich interplay between superconducting and density-wave orders. In the regime with weaker intralayer hopping, quasi-long-range spin-density-wave and pair-density-wave orders coexist, with the former being dominant. Across the transition, the spin-density-wave order becomes short-ranged, accompanied by the emergence of the quasi-long-range charge-density-wave order. Most significantly, superconductivity is dramatically enhanced in this regime, though it no longer exhibits the pair-density-wave signature. This quantum phase transition, driven by the competition between intralayer and interlayer hopping, provides a plausible microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed correlation between the superconducting transition temperature and ratio of out-of-plane to in-plane lattice constants. Our findings may assist future efforts in optimizing experimental conditions to further enhance superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.",

The collinear magnets with net-zero magnetization and spin-splitting mainly include altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet, which provide possibility to achieve hidden spin polarization (HSP) with net-zero spin polarization in total but non-zero local spin polarization. In addition to proposal of hidden altermagnetism, we hereby introduce this concept of hidden fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, where the total spin polarization is zero, but either of the two inversion-partner sectors possesses fully-compensated ferrimagnetism with non-zero local spin polarization in the real space. By the first-principle calculations, we predict that $PT$-bilayer $\\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_6}$ is a possible hidden fully-compensated ferrimagnet, showing fully-compensated ferrimagnetic HSP, which can be separated and observed by an out-of-plane external electric field.

    "summary": "Tensor Network (TN) Kernel Machines speed up model learning by representing parameters as low-rank TNs, reducing computation and memory use. However, most TN-based Kernel methods are deterministic and ignore parameter uncertainty. Further, they require manual tuning of model complexity hyperparameters like tensor rank and feature dimensions, often through trial-and-error or computationally costly methods like cross-validation. We propose Bayesian Tensor Network Kernel Machines, a fully probabilistic framework that uses sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors on TN factors to automatically infer model complexity. This enables automatic inference of tensor rank and feature dimensions, while also identifying the most relevant features for prediction, thereby enhancing model interpretability. All the model parameters and hyperparameters are treated as latent variables with corresponding priors. Given the Bayesian approach and latent variable dependencies, we apply a mean-field variational inference to approximate their posteriors. We show that applying a mean-field approximation to TN factors yields a Bayesian ALS algorithm with the same computational complexity as its deterministic counterpart, enabling uncertainty quantification at no extra computational cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and scalability.",

Although the corresponding band structure modifications below the CDW transition temperature are well established, only a few reports discuss the occurrence of the CDW fluctuating phase and its spectral features well above the transition temperature. Here, we report the direct observation of spectral features associated with CDW fluctuations at 295 K, using time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy. We investigated the transient melting and recovery of CDW fluctuations upon nonresonant ultrafast photoexcitation. Surprisingly, our results reveal that the coherent amplitude mode modulating the ultrafast CDW recovery persists at these elevated temperatures. The time-, energy- and momentum-resolved photoemission data supported by density functional perturbation theory further confirm that CDW fluctuations at these elevated temperatures are dominated by electron-phonon interaction. The analysis of these very localized microscopic fluctuations consequently provides new insights into the complex interplay between the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom at elevated temperatures and, therefore, on the nature of this quantum phase transition.",

    "summary": "Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\\mu}/t, {\\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.",

While the latter involves a single many-body Green's function, the former uses a multichannel Green's function in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. Quasiparticles and satellites are thus naturally treated on equal footing in the multichannel Dyson equation. To assess the accuracy of our approach we apply it here to the ground- and excited-state properties of the extended Hubbard dimer, an exactly solvable model for $H_2$. In particular, we focus on the potential energy surface as well as the corresponding spectral functions and HOMO-LUMO gaps, which are well-known challenges for many-body approximations such as second Born and $GW$. We show that the multichannel Dyson equation gives overall very good results for all properties considered and outperforms both $GW$ and second Born. In particular, the multichannel Dyson equation yields the correct ground-state energy and HOMO-LUMO gap in the dissociation limit contrary to $GW$.",

    "summary": "Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating atomistic simulations, offering scalable and efficient modeling with accuracy close to quantum calculations. However, their reliability and effectiveness in practical, real-world applications remain an open question. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related nanoporous materials are highly porous crystals with critical relevance in carbon capture, energy storage, and catalysis applications. Modeling nanoporous materials presents distinct challenges for uMLIPs due to their diverse chemistry, structural complexity, including porosity and coordination bonds, and the absence from existing training datasets. Here, we introduce MOFSimBench, a benchmark to evaluate uMLIPs on key materials modeling tasks for nanoporous materials, including structural optimization, molecular dynamics (MD) stability, the prediction of bulk properties, such as bulk modulus and heat capacity, and guest-host interactions. Evaluating over 20 models from various architectures on a chemically and structurally diverse materials set, we find that top-performing uMLIPs consistently outperform classical force fields and fine-tuned machine learning potentials across all tasks, demonstrating their readiness for deployment in nanoporous materials modeling. Our analysis highlights that data quality, particularly the diversity of training sets and inclusion of out-of-equilibrium conformations, plays a more critical role than model architecture in determining performance across all evaluated uMLIPs. We release our modular and extendable benchmarking framework at https://github.com/AI4ChemS/mofsim-bench, providing an open resource to guide the adoption for nanoporous materials modeling and further development of uMLIPs.",

In this work, we investigate how the choice of mapping from a two-dimensional lattice to a one-dimensional path affects the accuracy of the two-dimensional Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm. We systematically evaluate all mappings corresponding to a subset of the Hamiltonian paths of the $N \\cross N$ grid graphs up to $N=8$ and demonstrate that the fractal space-filling curves generally lead to faster convergence in ground state searches compared to the commonly used ``snake\" path. To explain this performance gain, we analyze various locality metrics and propose a scalable method for constructing high-performing paths on larger lattices by tiling smaller optimal paths. Our results show that such paths consistently improve simulation convergence, with the advantage increasing with system size.",

    "summary": "The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we introduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the measurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact (trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all within a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22 THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via parametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency. Our studies reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective excitations and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast phenomena.",

    "summary": "The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.",

    "summary": "Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy, we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost. Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly, ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery pipelines.",

On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators. We also explore a connection between higher Berry connections and functional Berry connections in the loop spaces of boundary conformal manifolds.",

    "summary": "Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) is an emerging field aimed at automating the design of quantum circuits for optimal performance. This paper introduces a novel QAS framework employing hybrid quantum reinforcement learning with quantum curriculum learning strategies, enabling learning agents to tackle increasingly complex quantum circuit design tasks. We benchmark four state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDQN, TD3) against their quantum-enhanced counterparts (QA2C, QPPO, QDDQN, QTD3) for optimizing variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Our approach progressively increases circuit depth and gate complexity during training, leveraging parameterized quantum circuits as function approximations. To improve learning efficiency and stability, all algorithms, both classical and quantum, are augmented with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). Experimental results show that quantum-enhanced RL significantly outperforms classical methods. In a 2-qubit environment, PERQDDQN achieves a success probability of 0.46 with ~3,000 optimal successes, surpassing classical PERDDQN (0.42, ~2,400). In the more complex 3-qubit setting, PERQDDQN and PERQTD3 reach success probabilities of ~0.47, with optimal success counts of ~3,800 and ~3,600, respectively, outperforming their classical counterparts. Additionally, we apply our QAS-QTN approach to a classification problem, where the optimized quantum circuit achieves an accuracy of 90.33\\%, outperforming quantum models consisting of random ansatz. This hybrid classical-quantum approach leads to faster convergence and more efficient quantum circuit designs, demonstrating its potential for advancing automated quantum architecture search.",

The transition is found to involve both diffusive and diffusionless mechanisms. Nucleation of 1T$^\\prime$ phase is initiated by the coalescence of neighboring Te monovacancies into divacancies, which are found to be mobile and can interact with other Te vacancies to form small triangular 1T$^\\prime$ islands. Growth of these islands proceeds either by incorporating pre-existing vacancies at the phase boundaries or, in their absence, by absorbing divacancies that migrate from the surrounding lattice. Once a critical island size is reached, vacancy-free growth becomes possible although with a higher activation barrier. Upon removal of external stimuli, the system reverts to 2H phase, during which Te vacancies reorganize into three-fold spoke-like vacancy lines at the island center. This reverse process and the subsequent 1T$^\\prime$$\\leftrightarrow$2H reversible transitions are diffusionless, rapid, do not require additional vacancies and can be driven by mild external stimuli. Although our analysis focuses on strain-induced transitions, the kinetic mechanisms are expected to be generalizable to other types of stimuli.",

    "summary": "The Self-Learning Monte Carlo (SLMC) method is a Monte Carlo approach that has emerged in recent years by integrating concepts from machine learning with conventional Monte Carlo techniques. Designed to accelerate the numerical study of interacting many-body systems, SLMC significantly improves sampling efficiency by constructing an effective model -- via machine learning methods -- based on configurations generated by conventional Monte Carlo methods and then proposes global updates based on the effective model. This enhancement leads to a substantial reduction in autocorrelation time, especially near the critical region, where traditional methods typically suffer from critical slowing down and increased computation complexity. Moreover, SLMC maintains statistical accuracy by implementing a cumulative update scheme that rigorously satisfies the detailed balance condition. And more recent applications have extended the SLMC to convolutional neural networks with applications not only in condensed matter physics but also high-energy physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum simulations. The generic applicability and high computational efficiency make SLMC a powerful and scalable framework for quantum Monte Carlo simulations of strongly correlated electron systems, extending the reach of numerical investigations beyond the limitations of conventional techniques.",

In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.",

At half-filling and for interaction strengths and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence, carried out dynamical vertex approximation (D$\\Gamma$A) simulations which allow for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the local ones of DMFT. Our numerical data show that close to half-filling the large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain doping value charge fluctuations become eventually larger in D$\\Gamma$A with respect to DMFT indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime. This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the D$\\Gamma$A kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute value of the) D$\\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT.",

    "summary": "We present and test a protocol to learn the matrix-product operator (MPO) representation of an experimentally prepared quantum state. The protocol takes as an input classical shadows corresponding to local randomized measurements, and outputs the tensors of a MPO which maximizes a suitably-defined fidelity with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum processor. Our method upgrades classical shadows to large-scale quantum computation and simulation experiments.",

    "summary": "Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF) circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.",

In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.",

Employing density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) that incorporates dynamical electronic correlation, we demonstrate that CaCrO$_3$ is a strongly correlated altermagnet. Our DFT+DMFT calculations successfully reproduce the correlated metallic behavior of CaCrO$_3$ and quantitatively capture the incoherence state observed experimentally. We also identify that the altermagnetic CaCrO$_3$ is a Hund's metal with a non-Fermi liquid behavior. Moreover, we find that altermagnetism can induce flat bands, and these incipient flat bands are further promoted by the strong renormalization from Hundness, which drives a heavy-fermion behavior. Hence, we propose that Hund's metals provide an ideal platform for hosting novel strongly correlated altermagnetism. Our work will promote the study of strongly correlated altermagnetism physics.",

We systematically investigate the band structures and electronic correlation effect to identify the key factors controlling superconductivity and pathways to enhance $T_c$. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct a bilayer two-orbital ($3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$) tight-binding model for a series of in-plane compression mimicking the substrate effect. We find the band energy at the $M$ point drops with the compression, leading to increase of the density of states at the Fermi level, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk under pressure. We then apply functional renormalization group (FRG) method to study the electronic correlation effect on the superconductivity. We find the $s_\\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust in the films, the same as the bulk. But somewhat surprisingly, for the films, we find $T_c$ can be enhanced by reducing the in-plane lattice constant, increasing the out-of-plane lattice constant, or further electron-doping. These findings are consistent with the itinerant picture of the superconductivity induced by spin-fluctuations and provide theoretical support for further boosting $T_c$ in future experiments.",

    "summary": "Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning. In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.",

    "summary": "Intertwined charge and spin correlations are ubiquitous in a wide range of transition metal oxides and are often perceived as intimately related to unconventional superconductivity. Theoretically envisioned as driven by strong electronic correlations, the intertwined order is usually found to be strongly coupled to the lattice as signaled by pronounced phonon softening. Recently, both charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) and superconductivity have been discovered in several Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates, in particular trilayer nickelates RE4Ni3O10 (RE=Pr, La). The nature of the intertwined order and the role of lattice-charge coupling are at the heart of the debate about these materials. Using inelastic X-ray scattering, we mapped the phonon dispersions in RE4Ni3O10 and found no evidence of phonon softening near the CDW wavevector over a wide temperature range. Calculations of the electronic susceptibility revealed a peak at the observed SDW ordering vector but not at the CDW wavevector. The absence of phonon softening is in sharp contrast to that in canonical oxide materials, notably cuprates. Our experimental and theoretical findings highlight the crucial role of the spin degree of freedom and establish a foundation for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and density-wave transitions in RP nickelate superconductors and beyond.",

Leveraging a newly developed SpinGNN++ framework that effectively handles spin-lattice coupled systems, we develop a comprehensive interatomic machine learning (ML) potential and apply it to twisted bilayer NiI2 (TBN). Structural relaxation introduces moir\\'e-periodic \"bumps\" that modulate the interlayer spacing by about 0.55~\\AA{} and in-plane ionic shifts up to 0.48~\\AA{}. Concurrently, our ML potential, which faithfully captures all key spin interactions, produces reliable magnetic configurations; combined with the generalized KNB mechanism, it yields accurate spin-driven polarization. For twist angles 1.89^{\\circ} \\leq \\theta \\leq 2.45^{\\circ}, both mechanisms become prominent, yielding rich polarization textures that combine ionic out-of-plane dipoles with purely electronic in-plane domains. In the rigid (unrelaxed) bilayer, skyrmions are absent; lattice relaxation is essential for generating polar-magnetic topologies. In contrast, near {\\theta} \\approx 60^{\\circ}, stacking-dependent ferroelectric displacements dominate, giving rise to polar meron-antimeron networks. These results reveal cooperative ionic and spin-driven ferroelectricity in TBN, positioning twisted vdW magnets as adaptable platforms for tunable multiferroic devices.",

    "summary": "Advanced structure prediction methods developed over the past decades include an unorthodox strategy of allowing atoms to displace into extra dimensions. A recently implemented global optimization of structures from hyperspace (GOSH) has shown promise in accelerating the identification of global minima on potential energy surfaces defined by simple interatomic models. In this study, we extend the GOSH formalism to more accurate Behler-Parrinello neural network (NN) potentials, make it compatible with efficient local minimization algorithms, and test its performance on nanoparticles and crystalline solids. For clusters modeled with NN potentials, four-dimensional optimization offers fairly modest improvement in navigating geometric relaxation pathways and incurs increased computational cost largely offsetting the benefit, but it provides a significant advantage in facilitating atom swaps in nanoalloys. In comparison, the introduction of a moderate, controlled bias for generating more physically sensible starting configurations, achieved via TETRIS-inspired packing of atomic blocks, has a more direct impact on the efficiency of global structure searches. The benchmarked systems are Lennard-Jones clusters, Au or Cu-Pd-Ag nanoparticles and binary Sn alloys described by NN potentials, and compounds with covalent B or BC frameworks modeled with density functional theory",

    "summary": "Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science and many-body physics, yet quantifying it in mixed quantum many-body systems has remained a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we introduce families of quantitative entanglement witnesses, constructed from partial transpose and realignment moments, which provide rigorous bounds on entanglement monotones. Our witnesses can be efficiently measured using SWAP tests or variants of Bell measurements, thus making them directly implementable on current hardware. Leveraging our witnesses, we present several novel results on entanglement properties of mixed states, both in quantum information and many-body physics. We develop efficient algorithms to test whether mixed states with bounded entropy have low or high entanglement, which previously was only possible for pure states. We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank using only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using four-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of quantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has been limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement phase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose negativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result that also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of entanglement in extensive many-body systems. Finally, we make progress on the entanglement required for quantum cryptography, establishing rigorous limits on pseudoentanglement and pseudorandom density matrices with bounded entropy. Our work opens new avenues for quantifying entanglement in large and noisy quantum systems.",

In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol.

    "summary": "Recently, the study of novel physical properties arising from the combination of altermagnetism and other matter phases has attracted widespread attention, such as the integration of altermagnetism and topology. However, research on the combination of altermagnetism and charge density waves remains relatively sparse. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate for the first time that altermagnetism and charge density waves can coexist in a two-dimensional material and predict monolayer WO to be such a material. Moreover, our calculations reveal that the altermagnetic order in monolayer WO stabilizes the $\\sqrt{2}\\times\\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave. Further, the $\\sqrt{2}\\times\\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave is not driven by Fermi-surface nesting but rather by strong electron-phonon coupling. More importantly, the $\\sqrt{2}\\times\\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave in monolayer WO leads to an anomalous transition from semimetal to metal. Therefore, we realize an anomalous charge density wave phase in altermagnetic WO. Considering the strong electron-phonon coupling and good metallic properties in the altermagnetic charge density wave state, our work may provide new insights into the realization of nontrivial altermagnetic superconductivity.",

First-principles calculations reveal that even minute Ni doping induces a substantial shift in the Fermi level (EF) and alters the density of states (DOS). Structural analysis via Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data shows anomalous behavior at x = 0.02, supported by Williamson-Hall and modified methods. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ti and Co K-edges further confirms a pronounced local structural change at this composition. These structural transitions are consistent with temperature-dependent resistivity (\\rho(T)) and thermopower (S(T)) data, which reflect changes in EF and disorder. Analysis of Lorentz number and scattering parameters reinforces the observed modifications in the electronic structure. The simultaneous enhancement of S and electrical conductivity at x = 0.02 is attributed to the disorder-to-order transition, leading to the marked rise in PF.",

    "summary": "Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating materials simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. However, despite significant advances, we identify a critical yet overlooked issue undermining their reliability: a systematic energy underprediction. This problem becomes starkly evident in large-scale thermodynamic stability assessments. By performing over 12 million calculations using nine MLIAPs for over 150,000 inorganic crystals in the Materials Project, we demonstrate that most frontier models consistently underpredict energy above hull (Ehull), a key metric for thermodynamic stability, total energy, and formation energy, despite the fact that over 90\\% of test structures (DFT-relaxed) are in the training data. The mean absolute errors (MAE) for Ehull exceed ~30 meV/atom even by the best model, directly challenging claims of achieving ``DFT accuracy'' for property predictions central to materials discovery, especially related to (meta-)stability. Crucially, we trace this underprediction to insufficient handling of symmetry degrees of freedom (DOF), constituting both lattice symmetry and Wyckoff site symmetries for the space group. MLIAPs exhibit pronounced errors (MAE for Ehull $>$ ~40 meV/atom) in structures with high symmetry DOF, where subtle atomic displacements significantly impact energy landscapes. Further analysis also indicates that the MLIAPs show severe energy underprediction for a large proportion of near-hull materials. We argue for improvements on symmetry-aware models such as explicit DOF encoding or symmetry-regularized loss functions, and more robust MLIAPs for predicting crystal properties where the preservation and breaking of symmetry are pivotal.",

    "summary": "Electronic systems with quadratic band touchings, commonly found in two- and three-dimensional materials such as Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, kagome metals, HgTe, and pyrochlore iridates, have attracted significant interest concerning the role of interactions in shaping their electronic properties. However, even in the simplest model of spinless fermions on a two-dimensional checkerboard lattice, the quantum phase diagram as a function of nearest-neighbor interaction remains under debate. We employ constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations (CP-QMC) simulations to investigate the problem using a two-dimensional torus geometry. We cross-validate our results on small lattices by comparing them with density-matrix renormalization group calculations, finding quantitative agreement. In particular, we implement an improved optimization scheme within the CP-QMC simulations, enabling the identification of a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal phase that was found in tensor-network studies on cylindrical geometries, but remains inaccessible to Hartree-Fock mean-field methods. The CP-QMC approach makes it possible to establish the emergence of this phase in a geometry that preserves lattice rotational symmetry and permits extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Our results show that the quantum phase diagram of spinless fermions on the checkerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion features three interaction-induced phases at half filling: a quantum anomalous Hall insulator at weak coupling, a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal at intermediate coupling, and a site-nematic insulator at strong coupling.",

    "summary": "Nano-acoustic strain generation in thin metallic films via ultrafast laser excitation is widely used in material science, imaging and medical applications. Recently, it was shown that transition metals, such as Titanium, exhibit enhanced photoacoustic transduction properties compared to noble metals, such as Silver. This work presents experimental results and simulations that demonstrate that among transition metals Tantalum exhibits superior photoacoustic properties. Experiments of nano-acoustic strain generation by femtosecond laser pulses focused on thin Tantalum films deposited on Silicon substrates are presented. The nano-acoustic strains are measured via pump-probe transient reflectivity that captures the Brillouin oscillations produced by photon-phonon interactions. The observed Brillouin oscillations are correlated to the photoacoustic transduction efficiency of the Tantalum thin film and compared to the performance of Titanium thin films, clearly demonstrating the superior photoacoustic transduction efficiency of Tantalum. The findings are supported by computational results on the laser-induced strains and their propagation in these thin metal film/substrate systems using a Two-Temperature Model in combination with thermo-mechanical Finite Element Analysis. Finally, the role of the metal transducer-substrate acoustic impedance matching is discussed and the possibility to generate appropriately modulated acoustic pulse trains inside the crystalline substrate structures for the development of crystalline undulators used for {\\gamma}-ray generation is presented.",

While the interference of lattice bosons has been extensively investigated, quantitative studies of the lattice fermion interference remain challenging. Here, we report the observation and quantitative characterization of interference patterns in low-temperature, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases. We develop a novel method to extract first-order correlations from interference patterns, which directly reflect the short-range phase coherence of lattice fermions. Mapping the nearest-neighbor correlations as a function of lattice filling and interaction strength, we observe a crossover from a metal to a Mott insulator. Moreover, at half filling, the measured correlations agree well with quantum Monte Carlo calculations and remain finite in the regime of strong repulsion, revealing virtual tunneling processes driven by quantum fluctuations.",

Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.",

    "summary": "Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents.",

We demonstrate that by using a few thousand shots from a single copy of the ladder simulator it is possible to estimate the bipartite quantum von Neumann entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. The estimation relies on an optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the bitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named Aquila. We discuss the limitations associated with finite sampling, sorting fidelity, adiabatic preparation, ramp-down of the Rabi frequency before measurement, and readout errors. We use cumulative probability distribution to compare Aquila results with high accuracy density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or exact results. The state preparation appears to be the main source of error. We discuss the large volume behavior of the cumulative probability distribution and show examples where for a finite number of shots, there appears to be some large enough size for which any given state is seen at most once with high probability. We show that the results presented can be extended to multipartite entanglement. We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations for large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the near future.",

To study the corresponding complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\\lambda$. Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover, we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state.

In holographic settings, it admits a geometric interpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and RT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a generalization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected multi-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps. We further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to vanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these quantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite structure in holographic quantum systems.",

    "summary": "We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature. Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\\kappa_{xy}/T$ is consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we show that positive $\\Gamma$ and negative $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ lead to a remarkable enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\\Gamma$ term go beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation effects, while those of the $\\Gamma^\\prime$ term are well captured at the classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such as $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated materials.",

Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded, retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable, ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.",

With the rapid advancement of quantum technologies, efficient quantum state preparation has become increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel approach for quantum state preparation based on the Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagram (LimTDD). LimTDD combines the advantages of tensor networks and decision diagrams, enabling efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states. Compared with the state-of-the-art quantum state preparation method, LimTDD demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency when dealing with complex quantum states, while also reducing the complexity of quantum circuits. Examples indicate that, in the best-case scenario, our method can achieve exponential efficiency gains over existing methods. This study not only highlights the potential of LimTDD in quantum state preparation but also provides a robust theoretical and practical foundation for the future development of quantum computing technologies.",

We show that in the correlated metallic regime, an accurate description of the conductivity requires not only the correct spectral function but also the inclusion of complex multi-electron processes encoded in vertex corrections. The crossover to the Mott insulating regime is marked by a vanishing contribution of vertex corrections to the DC conductivity. However, in the Mott insulating case, vertex corrections remain significant for the optical conductivity.",

Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that such a system supports the formation of trimers, namely, three-exciton bound states consisting of a single dipole in one layer and two dipoles in the second layer. At sufficiently low temperatures and densities, these trimers condense into a trimer superfluid phase. Increasing the excitonic density induces a quantum phase transition into a phase in which condensates of independent dipoles exist in both layers, in parallel to the trimers. We also study the thermal transitions out of these phases, and find that while the normal state is reached directly from the trimer superfluid, the thermal disordering of the two-superfluid phase involves an intermediate state which is either a trimer superfluid or a single excitonic condensate in the denser layer. A potential experimental realization using transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures is discussed.",

I then shortly review how to use the Bethe ansatz in $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, and then apply such procedure to the D5-D3 system. The dual field theory of such system corresponds to a defected version of $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, where the one-point functions of certain scalars are non-zero. The calculation of one-point functions is mapped to the overlap between matrix product states and Bethe states. The matrix product states are found to be solutions of the twisted Boundary Yang-Baxter equation, and equivalently the representations of extended twisted Yangian. By dressing procedure or coproduct property, we can connect the scalar matrix product state and higher dimension matrix product states. We have used the branching rules to find the connection with some detailed parameters needed to be fixed. Such method can not only be used for calculations of one-point functions in probe-branes system, but also shed some light on non-equilibrium system.",

Using large-scale tensor network and exact diagonalization methods, we determine the topology of the phase diagram, identifying an ``odd'' deconfined phase, confinement- and Higgs-induced valence bond solids (VBS), and a trivial paramagnet. Most notably, we uncover an exotic multicritical point along the self-dual line, where electric and magnetic excitations are related by an enriched $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ duality. This transition is marked by the simultaneous onset of confinement, Higgs condensation, translational symmetry breaking, and spontaneous duality symmetry breaking. Within our numerical accuracy, the transition appears continuous, involving the softening of excitation gaps for $e$ and $m$ anyons at finite momentum. At intermediate couplings, we further identify VBS phases with enlarged unit cells, potentially indicating frustration-induced crystalline order beyond commensurate limits.",

    "summary": "The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.",

We perform simulated randomised benchmarking across squeezing levels between 5 and 15 dB and find strong agreement with analytical estimates for high quality GKP qubits. As a demonstration of practical computation, we simulate a three-qubit Grover's algorithm within the QRL and identify a fundamental squeezing threshold -- approximately 10 dB -- beyond which the algorithm outperforms classical probability bounds.",

As part of the Munich Quantum Valley (MQV) ecosystem, the course fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between technical and business students, equipping them with the skills necessary to contribute to or lead in the emerging quantum industry. The QEL curriculum integrates two complementary tracks. First, technical students form teams where they engage in cutting-edge, industry-relevant research topics under academic supervision. Meanwhile business students in a parallel course explore commercialization strategies, risks, and opportunities within the quantum technology landscape. Midway through the semester, a selection of the business students join the technical course to form interdisciplinary teams which assess the feasibility of transforming scientific concepts into viable business solutions. The course culminates in three key deliverables: a publication-style technical report, a white paper analyzing the business potential and financial requirements, and a startup pitch presented to the quantum community at a Demo Day. This work outlines the course structure, objectives, and outcomes, providing a model for other institutions seeking to cultivate a highly skilled, innovation-driven workforce in quantum science and technology.",

    "summary": "The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \\emph{localized} for all investigated \\emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.",

However, the increasing system scale and data dimensionality introduce significant computational and memory burdens, particularly in large-scale industrial datasets, limiting detection efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes Rec-AD, a computationally efficient framework that integrates Tensor Train decomposition with the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). Rec-AD enhances training and inference efficiency through embedding compression, optimized data access via index reordering, and a pipeline training mechanism that reduces memory communication overhead. Fully compatible with PyTorch, Rec-AD can be integrated into existing FDIA detection systems without code modifications. Experimental results show that Rec-AD significantly improves computational throughput and real-time detection performance, narrowing the attack window and increasing attacker cost. These advancements strengthen edge computing capabilities and scalability, providing robust technical support for smart grid security.",

Our work provides a key first step toward solving the inverse scattering problem to extract effective multi-orbital models from information-dense RIXS measurements, which can be applied to a host of quantum materials.

    "summary": "Increasingly large datasets of microscopic images with atomic resolution facilitate the development of machine learning methods to identify and analyze subtle physical phenomena embedded within the images. In this work, microscopic images of honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples serve as datasets from which we automate the calculation of net magnetic moments and directional orientations of spin-ice configurations. In the first stage of our workflow, machine learning models are trained to accurately predict magnetic moments and directions within spin-ice structures. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an emergent unsupervised deep learning technique, are employed to generate high-quality synthetic magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images and extract latent feature representations, thereby reducing experimental and segmentation errors. The second stage of proposed methodology enables precise identification and prediction of frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments, effectively correlating structural and functional aspects of microscopic images. This facilitates the design of optimized spin-ice configurations with controlled frustration patterns, enabling potential on-demand synthesis.",

The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass it is determined that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at large phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. The transition temperature of Bose--Einstein condensates of these pairs is estimated. It is determined that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.",

    "summary": "The GdFeO$_3$-type perovskite antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$, calculated here to be altermagnetic for all three typical collinear antiferromagnetic orders, was suggested early on to be a Slater-type insulator, due in large part to its continuous metal-insulator transition and its small energy gap. Below the N\\'eel temperature, the gap opens along with ``weak magnetism'', accompanied by a discontinuity in the magnetic susceptibility. Most other properties remain continuous. Without explicit correlation in the band structure calculation, and neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC), already a gap opens. Inclusion of a modest on-site Coulomb repulsion ($U\\sim$ 1 eV) is sufficient to eliminate a SOC-induced small band overlap, reproducing the experimentally observed gap of several tens meV as reported earlier. This evidence supports the viewpoint that NaOsO$_3$ lies in an unusual crossover region between Slater and Mott insulator. The unreported altermagnetism in NaOsO$_3$ is demonstrated and its consequences are considered. The origin of the very weak magnetism has been investigated using a combination of {\\it ab initio} calculations and symmetry analysis of the magnetic space group, confirming the origin lying in the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbit coupling buttressed by altermagnetic order. After determining the easy axis, our calculation leads to an Os spin canting angle of about 3$^{\\circ}$, accounting for the observed weak magnetism and the resulting discontinuity in the susceptibility. The altermagnetism spin-split bands (up to $\\sim$100 meV) result in a chiral-split magnon spectrum in both acoustic and optical modes in the THz range, and lead to significant anomalous Hall conductivity upon hole doping.",

    "summary": "Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.",

    "summary": "Wide bandgap semiconductors with high room temperature mobilities are promising materials for high-power electronics. Stannate films provide wide bandgaps and optical transparency, although electron-phonon scattering can limit mobilities. In SrSnO3, epitaxial strain engineering stabilizes a high-mobility tetragonal phase at room temperature, resulting in a threefold increase in electron mobility among doped films. However, strain relaxation in thicker films leads to nanotextured coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases with unclear implications for optoelectronic performance. The observed nanoscale phase coexistence demands nano-spectroscopy to supply spatial resolution beyond conventional, diffraction-limited microscopy. With nano-infrared spectroscopy, we provide a comprehensive analysis of phase coexistence in SrSnO3 over a broad energy range, distinguishing inhomogeneous phonon and plasma responses arising from structural and electronic domains. We establish Nanoscale Imaging and Spectroscopy with Machine-learning Assistance (NISMA) to map nanotextured phases and quantify their distinct optical responses through a robust quantitative analysis, which can be applied to a broad array of complex oxide materials.",

    "summary": "The development of new experimental techniques for direct measurement of many-body correlations is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we propose a coincidence double-tip scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) that enables direct probing of spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations of sample electrons. Unlike conventional single-tip scanning tunneling microscopy, the double-tip STS employs a double-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM) equipped with two independently controlled tips, each biased at distinct voltages ($V_1$ and $V_2$). By simultaneously measuring the quantum tunneling currents $I_1(t)$ and $I_2(t)$ at locations $j_1$ and $j_2$, we obtain a coincidence tunneling current correlation $\\overline{\\langle I_1(t) I_2(t)\\rangle}$. Differentiating this coincidence tunneling current correlation with respect to the two bias voltages yields a coincidence dynamical conductance. Through the development of a nonequilibrium theory, we demonstrate that this coincidence dynamical conductance is proportional to a contour-ordered second-order current correlation function. For the sample electrons in a nearly free Fermi liquid state, the coincidence dynamical conductance captures two correlated dynamical electron propagation processes: (i) from $j_1$ to $j_2$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_1$, and (ii) from $j_2$ to $j_1$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_2$. For the sample electrons in a superconducting state, additional propagation channels emerge from the superconducting condensate, coexisting with the above normal electron propagation processes. Thus, the coincidence double-tip STS provides direct access to spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations, offering a powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated electron systems.",

Density-functional-theory calculations locate the lowest-energy Pr superlattices for both Ba- and Y-site substitution. In the Ba-site case, the smaller Pr ion pulls the surrounding atoms inward. This breathing-mode distortion pins charge-stripe walls to the Pr columns and forces them to align along the $c$ axis. Y-site Pr is larger than the host ion, produces an outward distortion, and fails to pin the stripes. Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo simulations show that the stripe correlation length rises in step with the structural correlation length of the Pr dopant as observed in prior experiments. We thus identify dopant-induced lattice pinning as the key mechanism behind 3D charge order in Pr-doped YBCO7. This approach provides quantitative guidelines for engineering electronic orders through targeted ionic substitution.",

To accurately model UC at reactor operating conditions, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using an active learning procedure to generate a comprehensive training dataset capturing diverse atomic configurations. The resulting MLIP predicts structural, elastic, thermophysical properties, defect formation energies, and diffusion behaviors, aligning well with experimental and theoretical benchmarks. This work significantly advances computational methods to explore UC, enabling efficient large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations essential for reactor fuel qualification.",

    "summary": "Twisted magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a promising route for multiferroic engineering, yet modeling large-scale moir\\'e superlattices remains challenging. Leveraging a newly developed SpinGNN++ framework that effectively handles spin-lattice coupled systems, we develop a comprehensive interatomic machine learning (ML) potential and apply it to twisted bilayer NiI2 (TBN). Structural relaxation introduces moir\\'e-periodic \"bumps\" that modulate the interlayer spacing by about 0.55~\\AA{} and in-plane ionic shifts up to 0.48~\\AA{}. Concurrently, our ML potential, which faithfully captures all key spin interactions, produces reliable magnetic configurations; combined with the generalized KNB mechanism, it yields accurate spin-driven polarization. For twist angles 1.89^{\\circ} \\leq \\theta \\leq 2.45^{\\circ}, both mechanisms become prominent, yielding rich polarization textures that combine ionic out-of-plane dipoles with purely electronic in-plane domains. In the rigid (unrelaxed) bilayer, skyrmions are absent; lattice relaxation is essential for generating polar-magnetic topologies. In contrast, near {\\theta} \\approx 60^{\\circ}, stacking-dependent ferroelectric displacements dominate, giving rise to polar meron-antimeron networks. These results reveal cooperative ionic and spin-driven ferroelectricity in TBN, positioning twisted vdW magnets as adaptable platforms for tunable multiferroic devices.",

By jointly optimizing the three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies.

    "summary": "The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped SmNiO$_2$, exhibiting the record-high transition temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer (IL) nickelates, has opened a new avenue for exploring design principles of superconductivity. Experimentally determining the electronic structure and magnetic interactions in this new system is crucial to elucidating the mechanism behind the enhanced superconductivity. Here, we report a Ni $L$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of superconducting Sm-based IL nickelate thin films Sm$_{1-x-y-z}$Eu$_x$Ca$_y$Sr$_z$NiO$_2$ (SECS). Dispersive paramagnonic excitations are observed in both optimally and overdoped SECS samples, supporting a spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenario. However, despite the two-fold enhancement of $T_c$ in the Sm-based nickelates compared to their Pr-based counterparts, the effective exchange coupling strength is reduced by approximately $20\\%$. This behavior contrasts with hole-doped cuprates, where magnetic interactions correlate positively with $T_c$, highlighting essential differences in their superconducting mechanisms.",

When applied out-of-sample, further data collection for improvement of the uMLIPs may, however, be required. In this work we demonstrate that, whenever the envisaged use of the MLIPs is global optimization, the data acquisition can follow an active learning scheme in which a gradually updated uMLIP directs the finding of new structures, which are subsequently evaluated at the density functional theory (DFT) level. In the scheme, we augment foundation models using a {\\Delta}-model based on this new data using local SOAP-descriptors, Gaussian kernels, and a sparse Gaussian Process Regression model. We compare the efficacy of the approach with different global optimization algorithms, Random Structure Search, Basin Hopping, a Bayesian approach with competitive candidates (GOFEE), and a replica exchange formulation (REX). We further compare several foundation models, CHGNet, MACE-MP0, and MACE-MPA. The test systems are silver-sulfur clusters and sulfur-induced surface reconstructions on Ag(111) and Ag(100). Judged by the fidelity of identifying global minima, active learning with GPR-based {\\Delta}-models appears to be a robust approach. Judged by the total CPU time spent, the REX approach stands out as being the most efficient.",

It is critical to the execution of many quantum algorithms, including those in quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose a family of efficient QSP algorithms tailored to different numbers of available ancilla qubits - ranging from no ancilla qubits, to a single ancilla qubit, to a sufficiently large number of ancilla qubits. Our algorithms are based on a novel decision diagram that is fundamentally different from the approaches used in previous QSP algorithms. Specifically, our approach exploits the power of Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagrams (LimTDDs) - a highly compact representation of quantum states that combines tensor networks and decision diagrams to reduce quantum circuit complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches and exhibit better scalability for large-scale quantum states, both in terms of runtime and gate complexity. Furthermore, our method shows exponential improvement in best-case scenarios. This paper is an extended version of [1], with three more algorithms proposed.",

    "summary": "Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ans\\\"atze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Using the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.",

    "summary": "We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830 T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable parameters of the original model.

We identify low-entanglement time slices of the scattering dynamics and exploit their efficient representation by tensor networks.

    "summary": "Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at https://h-bn.info, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.",

    "summary": "Altermagnets present a new class of fully compensated collinear magnetic order, where the two sublattices are not related merely by time-reversal combined with lattice translation or inversion, but require an additional lattice rotation. This distinctive symmetry leads to a characteristic splitting of the magnon bands; however the splitting is only partial -- residual degeneracies persist along certain lines in the Brillouin zone as a consequence of the underlying altermagnetic rotation. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic spin model on the checkerboard lattice and introduce additional interactions such as an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, that lift these degeneracies. The resulting magnon bands become fully gapped and acquire non-trivial topology, characterized by nonzero Chern numbers. We demonstrate the crucial role of altermagnetism for the generation of the Berry curvature. As a direct consequence of the topological magnons, we find finite thermal Hall conductivity $\\kappa_{xy}$, which exhibits a characteristic low-temperature scaling, $\\kappa_{xy}\\propto T^4$. Moreover, $\\kappa_{xy}$ changes sign under reversal of the magnetic field, exhibiting a sharp jump across zero field at low temperatures. We also demonstrate topologically protected chiral edge modes in a finite strip geometry.",

The hybrid improper ferroelectric Pc phase transitions to a competing P21 phase with purely in plane polarization upon switching, accompanied by a 90 degree rotation of weak ferromagnetism. Crucially, the Pc phase exhibits altermagnetism, while P21 displays full Brillouin zone band splitting, with persistent spin textures rotating 90 degree at the phase boundary.

We compare the resulting energetics of these electronic phases for the electron dispersion relation $E_k = c_2 k^2+c_4 k^4$. Motivated by the recent discovery of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene systems, we apply our analysis to relevant parameter regimes. We demonstrate that topological chiral superconducting phases (including a spin-unpolarized state) can be energetically favored over the spin-valley polarized Fermi liquid above the density of Wigner crystal phase. Our results show that the preference for chiral superconductivity is strongest when $c_2$ lies between zero and a negative value, corresponding to a system on the verge of forming a hole pocket around $k=0$. This finding suggests that superconductivity can arise from pure repulsive Coulomb interactions in systems with an almost flat band bottom, without relying on the pairing instability of a Fermi surface. This mechanism opens a new pathway to superconductivity beyond the conventional BCS mechanism.",

    "summary": "Accurately calculating band gaps for given crystal structures is highly desirable. However, conventional first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) within the local density approximation (LDA) fail to predict band gaps accurately. To address this issue, the quasi-particle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method is often employed as it is one of the most reliable theoretical approaches for predicting band gaps. Despite its accuracy, QSGW requires significant computational resources. To overcome this limitation, we propose combining QSGW with machine learning. In this study, we applied QSGW to 1,516 materials from the Materials Project [https://materialsproject.org/] and used machine learning to predict QSGW band gaps as a function of the partial density of states (PDOS) in LDA. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms linear regression approaches with linearly-independent descriptor generation [https://github.com/Hitoshi-FUJII/LIDG]. This model is a prototype for predicting material properties based on PDOS.",

    "summary": "Significant research advances have led to a consensus that the Fermi-Hubbard model and its extended variants are archetypal frameworks for elucidating the intertwined relationship between stripe orders and superconductivity in hole-doped high-$T_c$ materials. Notably, the Hubbard quantum simulator has recently achieved several remarkable breakthroughs, e.g., being successfully cooled down to the cryogenic regime and enabling the observation of stable fluctuating stripes. However, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing of electrons in the presence of stripes at low temperatures remains poorly understood due to the intricate interplay among the strongly correlated effects and non-negligible thermal fluctuations. Here, we conduct a close investigation of a partially-filled stripe in the representative $t$-$J$ and Fermi-Hubbard models with both numerical and analytical methods. Analogous to quantum gas microscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the high-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the ground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data demonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously pair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Then, using the effective theory of quantum colored string, we reconstruct the wavefunction and determine the nature of spinon pairing and its connection to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Furthermore, spinon singlet pairs enable the establishment of a long-range pair-pair correlation between double stripes. Our work offers new insights into the role of stripe orders in mediating $d$-wave superconductivity and paves the way for further exploration of multi-stripe-mediated pairing mechanisms in the Fermi-Hubbard model.",

    "summary": "Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization, placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes: deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom. Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape fractionalization and confinement.",

    "summary": "Neural network quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for addressing quantum many-body problems. While successful for model Hamiltonians, their application to molecular systems remains challenging for several reasons. In this work, we introduce three innovations to overcome some of the key limitations. (1) We propose two novel ans\\\"atzet hat hybridize tensor network and neural network states for addressing initialization challenges and enhancing the expressivity of tensor networks. First, we develop a bounded-degree graph recurrent neural network (BDG-RNN) ansatz that leverages graph-based updates, enabling applications to molecular electronic structure problems. Second, we introduce restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) inspired correlators to further enhance expressivity and improve accuracy, without dramatically modifying the underlying variational Monte Carlo (VMC) optimization framework. (2) We introduce a semi-stochastic algorithm for local energy evaluation, which significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. Combining these advances, we demonstrate that our approaches can achieve chemical accuracy in challenging systems, including the one-dimensional hydrogen chain H50, the iron-sulfur cluster [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]^{2-}, and a three-dimensional $3 \\times 3 \\times 2$ hydrogen cluster H18. These methods are implemented in an open-source package - PyNQS (https://github.com/Quantum-Chemistry-Group-BNU/PyNQS) to advance NQS methodologies for quantum chemistry.",

The MLIP was trained on density functional theory (DFT) data and validated against various quantities including energies, forces, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, and defect formation energies, achieving excellent agreement with DFT calculations, prior experimental results and our thermal conductivity measurement. The potential was then employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict key thermal properties such as melting point, thermal expansion, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. To further assess model accuracy, we fabricated a UN sample and performed new thermal conductivity measurements representative of single-crystal properties, which show strong agreement with the MLIP predictions. This work confirms the reliability and predictive capability of the developed potential for determining the thermal properties of UN.",

    "summary": "Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.",

    "summary": "Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become the gold standard for atomistic simulations, yet their extension to magnetic materials remains challenging because spin fluctuations must be captured either explicitly or implicitly. We address this problem for the technologically vital Fe-Cr-C system by constructing two deep machine learning potentials in DeePMD realization: one trained on non-magnetic DFT data (DP-NM) and one on spin-polarised DFT data (DP-M). Extensive validation against experiments reveals a striking dichotomy. The dynamic, collective properties, viscosity and melting temperatures are reproduced accurately by DP-NM but are incorrectly estimated by DP-M. Static, local properties, density, and lattice parameters are captured excellently by DP-M, especially in Fe-rich alloys, whereas DP-NM fails. This behaviour is explained by general properties of paramagnetic state: at high temperature, local magnetic moments self-average in space and time, so their explicit treatment is unnecessary for transport properties but essential for equilibrium volumes. Exploiting this insight, we show that a transfer-learning protocol, pre-training on non-magnetic DFT and fine-tuning on a small set of spin-polarised data, reduces the computational cost to develop magnetic MLIPs by more than an order of magnitude. Developing general-purpose potentials that capture static and dynamic behaviors throughout the whole composition space requires proper accounting for temperature-induced spin fluctuations in DFT calculations and correctly incorporating spin degrees of freedom into classical force fields.",

While extensively studied in non-interacting systems, the interplay between NHSE and strong electron correlations remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the non-Hermitian Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping, employing real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT), a novel extension to such non-Hermitian correlated models-to capture both local correlations and spatial inhomogeneities. By analyzing the end-to-end Green's function as probes of directional amplification, we demonstrate that strong correlations can suppress the skin effect, leading to a crossover from boundary-dominated to correlation-driven dynamics. Our systematic study reveals that correlations dominate at small to intermediate strength of asymmetric hopping, inducing exponential decay in the end-to-end Green's function, but higher strength of asymmetric hopping can restore amplification even at strong interaction. These results illuminate the tunable interplay between correlations and non-Hermitian physics, suggesting avenues for engineering non-reciprocal transport in correlated open quantum systems.",

Our approach employs two distinct machine-learning frameworks: a machine-learned force field to generate molecular dynamics trajectories and a second model for electric field gradients that preserves rotational and translational symmetries. By incorporating thermostat-driven molecular dynamics sampling, we enable the prediction of quadrupolar coupling constants in highly disordered materials at finite temperatures. We validate our method by predicting the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition temperature of the organic-inorganic halide perovskite MAPbI$_3$, obtaining results that closely match experimental data.",

This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.",

The tr-RIXS spectra reveal distinctive features, including two-kink continua at high energies and oscillatory spectral weight at low energies, both strongly influenced by the pump dynamics. By systematically analyzing the nonequilibrium tr-RIXS cross section under various pump configurations, we demonstrate how the spectra encode detailed information about the system's transient states, capturing instantaneous Hamiltonian parameters and the traversal of equilibrium quantum critical points during dynamic evolution. Notably, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between oscillatory features in the low-energy spectra and dynamical quantum phase transitions, offering a novel and experimentally accessible approach for their detection. These findings highlight the versatility of tr-RIXS as a powerful tool for studying quantum systems far from equilibrium and their critical phenomena.",

However, precise experimental adsorption energies are scarce due to the complexity of experiments, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain computationally expensive for large-scale material screening. Machine learning models trained on DFT data have emerged as a promising alternative, but face challenges such as functional dependency, limited labeled high-fidelity data, and interpretability issues. Herein, we present DOS Transformer for Adsorption (DOTA), a novel deep learning model that leverages local density of states (LDOS) as input to predict chemically accurate adsorption energies across metallic and intermetallic surfaces. DOTA integrates multi-head self-attention mechanisms with LDOS feature engineering to capture orbital interaction patterns, achieving superior accuracy and transferability. Pretrained on PBE-level DFT data, DOTA can be fine-tuned using minimal high-fidelity experimental or hybrid functional data to predict adsorption energies with chemical accuracy. The model resolves long-standing challenges, such as the \"CO puzzle\" and outperforms traditional theories, like the d-band center and Fermi softness models. It provides a robust framework for efficient catalyst and electrode screening, bridging the gap between computational and experimental approaches.",

We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2 error of $1.94 \\times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and \\(15-500\\times\\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery: exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical methods.",

However, because energy dissipation is typically introduced phenomenologically, its validity for describing nonequilibrium processes and long-time dynamics in real materials remains questionable. In this paper, we derive a generalized stochastic LLG equation from first principles for spin-orbital coupled Mott insulators, explicitly incorporating the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and lattice vibrations. Our approach is based on the path-integral formalism formulated along the Keldysh contour, which naturally accounts for dissipation and thermal fluctuations through interactions with a phonon bath and emergent stochastic noise. We benchmark our theoretical framework by numerically integrating the equations of motion for a two-orbital spin chain coupled to Einstein phonons. The resulting energy relaxation mimics realistic cooling dynamics, exhibits nontrivial transient behavior during thermalization, and accurately reproduces thermodynamic properties upon equilibration. This demonstrates the robustness and reliability of our formalism for capturing both equilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of dissipative spin dynamics in strongly correlated systems. We further show how electron-phonon coupling induces hybridization between electronic and phononic modes in the excitation spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate how the conventional LLG equations can be recovered as a limiting case of our microscopic theory, and discuss their applicability to real materials.",

Here, we report that superconductivity occurs in a uniform and fully ordered N${\\'e}$el state in a single-layer cuprate La$_2$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$ with a small amount of excess oxygen $(\\delta = 0.015)$ as demonstrated by the $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance measurement. A uniform oxygen distribution in the crystal is crucial for achieving microscopic phase coexistence and overcoming the miscibility gap associated with the staging instability; self-organized periodic oxygen arrangement driven by mobile oxygen atoms. This finding prompts the reconsideration of superconductivity in cuprates, highlighting that it can emerge in a robust N${\\'e}$el state that retains sizable magnetic moments and hosts only a small carrier density.",

We also report unique electronic behaviour, including amplification of the electronic band-gap with tensile strain, and insulating, charge-ordered phases with non-orthorhombic tilt patterns. To provide clarity to the trends we observe, we also investigate the coupling between the breathing mode and strain, where we observe certain strains to directly favour and disfavour the creation of the breathing mode (and thus the associated charge-ordering). The amplification of the band gap with strain is understood in terms of a cooperative coupling between the elastic constraint and octahedral breathing, which expands on the previously reported triggered mechanism mediated by octahedral tilting.",

    "summary": "Valley polarization and altermagnetism are two emerging fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics, offering unprecedented opportunites for information encoding and processing in novel energy-efficient devices. By coupling valley and spin degrees of freedom with ferroic orders such as ferroelectricity, nonvolatile memory functionalities can be achieved. Here, we propose a way to realize ferroelectric-valley (FE-valley) and FE-altermagnetic coupling in a bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) honeycomb lattices based on an effective four-band spin-full $k\\cdot p$ model. Our proposal is validated in bilayer MnPTe$_3$ through first-principles calculations. A spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization occurs in AB- (BA-) stacking configuration, which is reversibly switchable via interlayer sliding. Remarkably, polarization reversal simultaneously inverts both layer-resolved valley polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. This dual control enables tunable layer-spin-locked anomalous valley Hall effects and an unprecedented magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets. Our work establishes a general paradigm for electrically programmable valleytronic and spintronic functionalities of 2D AFM materials.",

    "summary": "The performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) cables, a contender for copper-wire replacement, is tied to its metallic and semi-conducting-like conductivity responses with temperature; the origin of the semi-conducting-like response however is an underappreciated incongruity in literature. With controlled aspect-ratio and doping-degree, over 61 unique cryogenic experiments including anisotropy and Hall measurements, CNT cable performance is explored at extreme temperatures (65 mK) and magnetic fields (60 T). A semi-conducting-like conductivity response with temperature becomes temperature-independent approaching absolute-zero, uniquely demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous fluctuation induced tunneling; complete de-doping leads to localized hopping, contrasting graphite's pure metallic-like response. High-field magneto-resistance (including +22% longitudinal magneto-resistance near room-temperature) is analyzed with hopping and classical two-band models, both similarly yielding a parameter useful for conductor development. Varying field-orientation angle uncovers two-and four-fold symmetries from Aharonov-Bohm-like corrections to curvature-induced bandgap. Tight-binding calculations using Green's Function formalism model large-scale, coherent transport in commensurate CNT bundles in magnetic field, revealing non-uniform transmission across bundle cross-sections with doping restoring uniformity; independent of doping, transport in bundle-junction-bundle systems are predominantly from CNTs adjacent to the other bundle. The final impact is predicting the ultimate conductivity of heterogeneous CNT cables using temperature and field-dependent transport, surpassing conductivity of traditional metals.",

The valley photovoltaic concept is a novel implementation of a hot-carrier solar cell and leverages the valley scattering effect under large electric field to potentially achieve high voltage and high efficiency. Fabricated devices have shown S-shaped current-voltage curves, low fill factor, and thus low efficiency. We hence develop the first device model for valley photovoltaics. Our model includes electric-field-dependent valley scattering rates extracted from previous ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the condition of nonequilibrium carrier populations in the satellite valleys is not enough for valley photovoltaics to achieve high efficiency. We also show that increasing the built-in electric field of the valley-scattering region does not improve efficiency, contrary to previous suggestion.",

We consider a two-leg ladder lattice coupled to Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions and verify the results of the VQE simulations using tensor network methods. We find that for varying Hamiltonian parameter regimes and in the presence of external charges, the VQE is able to arrive at the gauge-invariant ground state without explicitly enforcing gauge invariance through penalty terms. Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are performed on IBM's quantum platform. Thus, VQEs are seen to be a promising tool for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs, and could pave the way for studies of other gauge groups. We find that the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is favorable for avoiding barren plateaus. At the same time, it is not clear how to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore, strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.",

At half-filling and for interaction strengths and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence, carried out dynamical vertex approximation (D$\\Gamma$A) simulations which allow for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the local ones of DMFT. Our numerical data show that close to half-filling the large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain doping value, charge fluctuations eventually become larger in D$\\Gamma$A with respect to DMFT indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime. This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the D$\\Gamma$A kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute value of the) D$\\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT.",

We uncover a universal relationship between bipartite entanglement entropy and particle number after the barrier in a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard system with an external asymmetric potential. Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks - a novel machine learning architecture - we learn this relationship across a broad range of interaction strengths with near-perfect predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a simple analytical binary-entropy-like expression that quantitatively captures the observed correlation for fixed parameters. Our findings open new avenues for characterizing quantum correlations in transport phenomena and provide a powerful framework for predicting entanglement evolution in quantum systems.",

    "summary": "A diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of many-body perturbation theory was recently introduced [J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2025, 16, 3047]. This framework allows us to extend single-reference (SR) Green's function methods defined at the diagrammatic level naturally into multi-reference case, as previously exemplified by the formulation of multi-reference direct random phase approximation (MR-dRPA) and the multi-reference second-order screened exchange approximation (MR-SOSEX). In this work, we further elaborate this framework and use it to develop MR generalizations of two other RPA variants, namely, particle-hole (ph) RPA with exchange (MR-RPAx) and particle-particle RPA (MR-ppRPA). We define these two MR generalizations by infinite order resummations of the generalized `ring' and `ladder' diagrams with antisymmetrized interaction vertices, respectively, which incorporate the contributions from the active-space connected two-body Green's functions. As for MR-dRPA, we derive unified sets of equations that hold at both SR and MR levels for RPAx and ppRPA, respectively. We perform numerical studies of prototypical systems using the three MR-RPA methods and carry out a perturbative analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their behaviors. We find that error cancellation between the second and third orders is a key factor for both SR-RPA and MR-RPA. In addition, we observe that MR-phRPA (MR-dRPA and MR-RPAx) and MR-ppRPA tend to overestimate and underestimate correlation energies, respectively, suggesting that a better accuracy can be achieved by further combining these two channels in the future.",

Recently, tensor network decompositions have emerged as powerful tools for tackling such equations by reducing memory usage and computational complexity. In this paper, we solve for equilibrium density and density-density correlation functions of liquids in confined heterogeneous environments using tensor network methods. We demonstrate that these functions admit high compression when their lengthscale dependence is encoded via quantized tensor trains or when their spatial-coordinate dependence is represented in standard tensor-train format, but not with respect to their dependence on distinct particle coordinates.",

With it, machine learning models were trained on 1,014 Mo-Re-W structures to enable a large compilation of elastic and thermal properties over the complete Mo-Re-W compositional domain with extreme resolution. A series of heat maps spanning the full compositional domain were generated to visually present the impact of alloy constituents on the alloy properties. Our findings identified a balanced (Mo,W) + Re blend as a promising composition for high temperature applications, attributed to a strong and stable (Mo,W) matrix with high Re content and the formation of strengthening (W,Re) precipitates that enhanced mechanical performance at 1600oC. Several Mo-Re-W compositions were manufactured to experimentally validate the computational predictions. This approach provides an efficient and system-agnostic pathway for designing and optimizing alloys for high-temperature applications.",

    "summary": "Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.

It can be estimated in a large compositional space from pair wise interactions between elements, for which machine learning has recently provided the most accurate predictions. Further improvements requires acquiring high quality data in liquids where models are poorly constrained. In this study, we propose an active learning approach to identify in which liquids additional data are most needed to improve an initial dataset that covers over 400 binary liquids. We identify a critical need for new data on liquids containing refractory elements, which we address by performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for 29 equimolar alloys of Ir, Os, Re and W. This enables more accurate predictions of the enthalpy of mixing, and we discuss the trends obtained for refractory elements of period 6. We use clustering analysis to interpret the results of active learning and to explore how our features can be linked to Miedema's semi empirical theory.",

    "summary": "Atomistic simulations of multi-component systems require accurate descriptions of interatomic interactions to resolve details in the energy of competing phases. A particularly challenging case are topologically close-packed (TCP) phases with close energetic competition of numerous different site occupations even in binary systems like Fe-Mo. In this work, machine learning (ML) models are presented that overcome this challenge by using features with domain knowledge of chemistry and crystallography. The resulting data-efficient ML models need only a small set of training data of simple TCP phases $A$15, $\\sigma$, $\\chi$, $\\mu$, $C$14, $C$15, $C$36 with 2-5 WS to reach robust and accurate predictions for the complex TCP phases $R$, $M$, $P$, $\\delta$ with 11-14 WS. Several ML models with kernel-ridge regression, multi-layer perceptrons, and random forests, are trained on less than 300 DFT calculations for the simple TCP phases in Fe-Mo. The performance of these ML models is shown to improve systematically with increased utilization of domain knowledge. The convex hulls of the $R$, $M$, $P$ and $\\delta$ phase in the Fe-Mo system are predicted with uncertainties of 20-25 meV/atom and show very good agreement with DFT verification. Complementary X-ray diffraction experiments and Rietveld analysis are carried out for an Fe-Mo R-phase sample. The measured WS occupancy is in excellent agreement with the predictions of our ML model using the Bragg Williams approximation at the same temperature.",

Using the Auxiliary master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics. Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.",

Experimentally, this approach is straightforward, except when distinct orderings occur with identical or almost identical symmetry breaking. Here we show that the cuprate system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$ hosts two distinct orderings with almost identical translational symmetry breaking. Only when applying site-sensitive resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), charge ordering can be conclusively differentiated from a super-lattice structure. These two orderings occur with almost the same in-plane symmetry but manifest at different atomic sites and display different temperature dependence. Differentiating these orders provides an important clue to the anomalous behavior of PrBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ within the 123-series of high-temperature superconductors. We conclude that the symmetry breaking at the Pr-site is unfavorable for superconducting pairing.",

This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta, and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific, prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating further temporal evolution.",

Our results show that a sudden quench into a PT-broken phase generally leads to exponential growth in these quantities, driven by the biorthogonal density matrix's non-positivity. In contrast to generic interacting systems, we observe a surprising linear decay in the TTC entropy for non-interacting fermionic systems.

Leveraging this, we construct a Josephson junction setup, where an insulating barrier in the form of a Mott-insulator is sandwiched between two superfluid phases. This is obtained by spatially varying either the statistical phase or the strength of the on-site interaction potential on which the ground state of the system depends. Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can produce the Josephson effect. Furthermore, it is observed that continuous particle flow over time is achievable in this proposed model solely by creating an initial phase difference without any external biasing.",

These lecture notes serve as a detailed guide for implementing the aTTN algorithms. We present a variational algorithm for ground state search and discuss the measurement of observables, and offer an open-source implementation within the Quantum TEA library. We benchmark the performance of the ground state search for different parameters and hyperparameters in the square lattice quantum Ising model and the triangular lattice Heisenberg model for up to $32 \\times 32$ spins.

One possible approach that enables faster computations in four-dimensional lattice theories is the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG). However, the computational cost remains substantial and requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called the Triad-ATRG, which is based on the ATRG and other improved TRG variants with triad network representation. This method achieves lower scaling with respect to the bond dimension, while minimizing the loss of accuracy in the free energy and other physical quantities. We also present parallel implementations of both the ATRG and Triad-ATRG on multiple GPUs, which significantly improve performance compared to CPU-based calculations for the four-dimensional system.",

    "summary": "This work proposes an efficient numerical approach for compressing a high-dimensional discrete distribution function into a non-negative tensor train (NTT) format. The two settings we consider are variational inference and density estimation, whereby one has access to either the unnormalized analytic formula of the distribution or the samples generated from the distribution. In particular, the compression is done through a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we use existing subroutines to encode the distribution function in a tensor train format. In the second stage, we use an NTT ansatz to fit the obtained tensor train. For the NTT fitting procedure, we use a log barrier term to ensure the positivity of each tensor component, and then utilize a second-order alternating minimization scheme to accelerate convergence. In practice, we observe that the proposed NTT fitting procedure exhibits drastically faster convergence than an alternative multiplicative update method that has been previously proposed. Through challenging numerical experiments, we show that our approach can accurately compress target distribution functions.",

    "summary": "The spin-$1$ orthogonal dimer chain is investigated using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. A transformation to a basis that uses the local eigenstates of the orthogonal dimers, while retaining the local spin states for the parallel spins, allows for more effective implementation of the symmetries, as well as mitigating the entanglement bias of DMRG. A rich ground state phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of inter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration) and an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective Haldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground state wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static properties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and the spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully selected set of representative states is presented. The static properties are complemented by exploring the low-energy dynamics through the calculation of the dynamic structure factor. The results provide crucial insight into the emergence of complex ground state phases from the interplay between strong interactions, geometric frustration, and external magnetic field for interacting S=1 Heisenberg spins.",

    "summary": "In this study, we systematically investigate the thermal and electronic transport properties of two-dimensional PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure by combining first-principles calculations, Boltzmann transport theory, and machine learning methods. The heterostructure exhibits a unique honeycomb-like corrugated and asymmetric configuration, which significantly enhances phonon scattering. Moreover, the relatively weak interatomic interactions in PbSe/PbTe lead to the formation of anti-bonding states, resulting in strong anharmonicity and ultimately yielding ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (${\\kappa_{\\rm L}}$). In the four-phonon scattering model, the ${\\kappa_{\\rm L}}$~values along the $x$ and $y$ directions are as low as 0.37 and 0.31 W/mK, respectively. Contrary to the conventional view that long mean free path acoustic phonons dominate heat transport, we find that optical phonons contribute approximately 59\\% of the lattice thermal conductivity in this heterostructure. These optical phonons exhibit large Gr\\\"uneisen parameters, strong anharmonic scattering, and relatively high group velocities, thereby playing a crucial role in the low ${\\kappa_{\\rm L}}$ regime. Further analysis of thermoelectric performance shows that at a high temperature of 800 K, the heterostructure achieves an exceptional dimensionless figure of merit ($ZT$) of 5.3 along the $y$ direction, indicating outstanding thermoelectric conversion efficiency. These findings not only provide theoretical insights into the transport mechanisms of PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure but also offer a practical design strategy for developing high-performance two-dimensional layered thermoelectric materials.",

Based on a $G$-compatible discretization of the parameter space, we incorporate both group cochains and parameter-space differentials, enabling the systematic construction of equivariant topological invariants. We derive a fixed-point formula for the higher Berry invariant in the case where the symmetry action has isolated fixed points. This reveals that the phase transition point between Haldane and trivial phases acts as a monopole-like defect where higher Berry curvature emanates.

As the size of the systems increases, contracting larger tensor networks becomes computationally demanding. In this work, we study distributed memory architectures intended for high-performance computing implementations to solve this task. Efficiently distributing the contraction task across multiple nodes is critical, as both computational and memory costs are highly sensitive to the chosen partitioning strategy. While prior work has employed general-purpose hypergraph partitioning algorithms, these approaches often overlook the specific structure and cost characteristics of tensor network contractions. We introduce a simulated annealing-based method that iteratively refines the partitioning to minimize the total operation count, thereby reducing time-to-solution. The algorithm is evaluated on MQT Bench circuits and achieves an 8$\\times$ average reduction in computational cost and an 8$\\times$ average reduction in memory cost compared to a naive partitioning.",

However, design of these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials' design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a \\emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules, which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling, depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from fast, coarse simulations.",

This is especially relevant for financial time series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods. We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation method.",

We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation.",

An in-principle exact (in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory, where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density, is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS) lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of such an ansatz to ease convergence and improve substantially the description of density profiles (localized orbital occupations in this context) in strongly correlated systems.",

Yet the lack of reliable, general uncertainty quantification limits their safe, wide-scale use. Here we introduce a unified, scalable uncertainty metric \\(U\\) based on a heterogeneous model ensemble with reuse of pretrained uMLIPs. Across chemically and structurally diverse datasets, \\(U\\) shows a strong correlation with the true prediction errors and provides a robust ranking of configuration-level risk. Leveraging this metric, we propose an uncertainty-aware model distillation framework to produce system-specific potentials: for W, an accuracy comparable to full-DFT training is achieved using only \\(4\\%\\) of the DFT labels; for MoNbTaW, no additional DFT calculations are required. Notably, by filtering numerical label noise, the distilled models can, in some cases, surpass the accuracy of the DFT reference labels. The uncertainty-aware approach offers a practical monitor of uMLIP reliability in deployment, and guides data selection and fine-tuning strategies, thereby advancing the construction and safe use of foundation models and enabling cost-efficient development of accurate, system-specific potentials.",

Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage.",

    "summary": "Understanding how molecules arrange on surfaces is fundamental to surface chemistry and essential for the rational design of catalytic and functional materials. In particular, the energetically most stable configuration provides valuable insight into adsorption-related processes. However, the search for this configuration is a global optimization problem with exponentially growing complexity as the number of adsorbates and possible adsorption sites increases. To address this, we express the adsorption energy as a sum of multi-adsorbate interaction terms, evaluated using our in-house trained machine learning interatomic potential MACE-Osaka24, and formulate the search for the most stable configuration as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem. We employ a tensor-train-based method, Tensor Train Optimizer (TTOpt), to solve the HUBO problem and identify optimal adsorption configurations of CO and NO molecules on various alloys up to full surface coverage. Our results show that including interaction terms up to third order may be sufficient to approximate adsorption energies within chemical accuracy and to identify optimal configurations. We also observed that TTOpt performs better with the HUBO formulation, suggesting that third-order terms help preserve correlations between adsorption sites, which allow TTOpt to optimize configurations more effectively. The extensive benchmarks across various alloys, surface geometries, and adsorbates demonstrate the robustness and applicability of using TTOpt to solve HUBO-type global optimization problems in surface chemistry. In contrast to quantum and digital annealers, which have recently been applied to similar global optimization tasks but are restricted to cost functions with at most quadratic terms, our approach can incorporate higher-order terms in a straightforward manner and does not require specialized hardware.",

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising model show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.",

    "summary": "The \"CO adsorption puzzle\", a persistent failure of utilizing generalized gradient approximations (GGA) in density functional theory to replicate CO's experimental preference for top-site adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, remains a critical barrier in surface chemistry. While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The above work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.",

    "summary": "Generalized symmetry extends the usual notion of symmetry to ones that are of higher-form, acting on subsystems, non-invertible, etc. The concept was originally defined in the field theory context using the idea of topological defects. On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is moved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask how to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the unitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit constrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for symmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome, which we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines the symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast, for unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the Cheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full description. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator representations play an important role in our discussion.",

It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.",

Our construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf algebras and to quantum groups. The approach is further applied to the quantum group $U_q[su(2)]$, for which we construct 2D generalizations of its generators, analyze $q$-deformed singlet states, and derive a 2D R-matrix satisfying an intertwining relation in the semiclassical limit. Additionally, we show how tensor network states, particularly PEPS, naturally induce 2D coalgebra structures when supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions. Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical symmetries in quantum many-body physics.",

We find that the local density of states of at each site mirrors that of a homogeneous system with the same local filling.

With the emergence of these exotic point-like particles, it is natural to ask what phases can arise in interacting many-anyon systems. To study this topic, we consider the particular case of Fibonacci anyons subject to an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor repulsion on a two-leg ladder. Focusing on the case of half-filling, for low interaction strengths an ''anyonic'' metal is found, whereas for strong repulsion, the anyons form an insulating charge-density wave. Within the latter regime, we introduce an effective one-dimensional model up to sixth order in perturbation theory arising from anyonic superexchange processes. We numerically identify four distinct phases of the effective model, which we characterize using matrix product state methods. These include both the ferro- and antiferromagnetic golden chain, a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase, and an incommensurate phase.",

We uncover a magnetic-field-induced crossover in the scattering rate: $1/\\tau \\propto B^2$ in the Born regime and $1/\\tau \\propto B^{-2}$ in the unitarity limit. This crossover gives rise to distinct MR behaviors in the EQL, characterized by linear transverse MR ($\\rho_{xx} \\propto B$) and negative longitudinal MR ($\\rho_{zz} \\propto B^{-2}$). This dichotomy implies insulating behavior when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current, and metallic behavior when it is parallel. In the unitarity limit, we further derive a universal relation that enables direct experimental determination of the impurity density from $\\rho_{xx}$ and $\\rho_{xy}$. Our results establish a quantum--classical correspondence that remains valid even in the EQL, provided that the field dependences of the scattering rate and quantum corrections are properly incorporated.",

The intensity of these excitations reaches a maximum near the midpoint between the center and the boundary of the Brillouin zone, and decreases toward the zone boundary; this behavior contrasts with that of the spin-flip ($\\Delta S = 1$) excitations typically observed via inelastic neutron scattering or Cu $L_3$-edge RIXS. The momentum dependence of the intensity is described by the spin-exchange dynamical structure factor. A phenomenological analysis of the symmetry between the polarization and the $d$ orbital explains the resonance condition for the two-spinon excitations.",

    "summary": "Strong electron correlations drive Mott insulator transitions. Yet, there exists no framework to classify Mott insulators by their degree of correlation. Cuprate superconductors, with their tunable doping and rich phase diagrams, offer a unique platform to investigate the evolution of those interactions. However, spectroscopic access to a clean half-filled Mott-insulating state is lacking in compounds with the highest superconducting onset temperature. To fill this gap, we introduce a pristine, half-filled thallium-based cuprate system, Tl$_2$Ba$_5$Cu$_4$O$_{10+x}$ (Tl2504). Using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), we probe long-lived magnon excitations and uncover a pronounced kink in the magnon dispersion, marked by a simultaneous change in group velocity and lifetime broadening. Modeling the dispersion within a Hubbard-Heisenberg approach, we extract the interaction strength and compare it with other cuprate systems. Our results establish a cuprate universal relation between electron-electron interaction and magnon zone-boundary dispersion. Superconductivity seems to be optimal at intermediate correlation strength, suggesting an optimal balance between localization and itinerancy.",

The 6H perovskites with composition A$_3$BB'$_2$O$_9$ exhibit unique layered structural alternations and typically adopt an antiferromagnetic ground state. Here, we report the discovery that several 6H perovskites are indeed altermagnets exhibiting non-relativistic spin-split bands. We also explore the possible presence of net magnetization due to spin-orbit coupling in these materials, as well as the manifestation of giant piezomagnetism. Since the single crystals of 6H perovskites can be readily grown and cleavable, our findings provide a new avenue to study the cleaved atomically-flat surfaces of altermagnets with advanced experimental techniques such as spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to explore their spin splitting nature.",

    "summary": "Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize. Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks, including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture, offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.",

It mitigates the sign problem while avoiding the ergodicity issues that are intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In this study, we apply the WV-HMC method to the Hubbard model away from half filling, which is known to suffer from a severe sign problem. We compute the number density on lattices of spatial size $6 \\times 6$ and $8 \\times 8$ at inverse temperature $\\beta = 6.4$ using $N_t = 20$ Trotter steps. Our results show that the WV-HMC method remains effective even in parameter regions where non-thimble Monte Carlo methods fail due to severe sign problems. In this work, we employ direct solvers for fermion matrix inversion, with a computational cost of $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom and proportional to the spacetime lattice volume. An alternative algorithm employing pseudofermions and iterative solvers, which reduces the cost to $O(N^2)$ at the expense of careful parameter tuning, will be discussed in a separate publication.",

    "summary": "The electron in a solid can be considered a bound state of the three independent, fundamental degrees of freedom creating quasi-particles: spinons, carrying the electron spin; plasmons carrying the collective charge mode and orbitons carrying its orbital degree of freedom. These fundamental degrees of freedom could form ordering states in which dynamics or collective motions could occurr and manifest as low-energy excitations. The exotic properties that appear in the materials exhibiting these electronic orderings are associated with these low-energy excitations. Although the orbital order (OO) and its coupling to the spin system creates very interesting phenomena, the microscopic origin of OO has been much less explored than other electronic properties as it is very difficult to directly access experimental information from OO. Due to the recent improvement in energy resolution and flux, soft x-ray resonant inelastic scattering (RIXS) allows for a re-examination of orbital excitations in manganites. Here, we present a study of low energy excitations in half doped A-site ordered SmBaMn_{2}O_{6} through a combination of RIXS and soft x-ray resonant elastic scattering (REXS) measurements. The obtained experimental data confirm the OO at \\mathbf{q} = (0.25, 0.25, 0) and find various low energy excitations below 200 meV. while several excitations can be assigned to be of magnetic and phononic origin, a group of excitations between 80 and 200 meV show a temperature dependence distinctively following that of the OO making them possible candidates for orbital excitations.",

    "summary": "We show how to construct Landau-like free energy potentials using a machine-learning approach. For concreteness, we focus on perovskite oxide PbTiO$_{3}$. We work with a training set obtained from Monte Carlo simulations based on an atomistic ''second-principles'' potential for PbTiO$_{3}$. We rely exclusively on data that would be experimentally accessible -- i.e., temperature-dependent polarization and strain, both with and without external electric fields and stresses applied --, to explore scenarios where the training set could be obtained from laboratory measurements. We introduce a scheme that allows us to identify optimal polynomial models of the temperature-dependent free energy surface, mapped as a function of the homogeneous electric polarization and homogeneous strain. Our results for PbTiO$_{3}$ show that a very simple polynomial -- where only two parameters depend linearly on temperature -- is sufficient to yield a correct description of the material's behavior. Remarkably, the obtained models also capture the subtle couplings by which elastic strain controls key features of ferroelectricity in PbTiO$_{3}$ -- i.e., the symmetry of the polar phase and the discontinuous character of the transition --, despite the fact that no effort was made to include such information in the training set. We emphasize the distinctive aspects of our methodology (which relies on an original form of validation step) by comparing it with the usual machine-learning approach for model construction. Our results illustrate how physically motivated models can have remarkable predictive power, even if they are derived from a limited amount of data. We argue that such ''third-principles'' models can be the basis for predictive macroscopic or mesoscopic simulations of ferroelectrics and other materials undergoing non-reconstructive structural transitions.",

Remarkably, electron doping of LaMn2Si2 is predicted to substantially enhance the Hall conductivity, with values reaching up to -650 S/cm.

    "summary": "In multilayered high-Tc cuprates with three or more CuO2 layers per unit cell, the inner CuO2 planes (IPs) are spatially separated from the dopant layers and thus remain cleaner than the outer planes (OPs). While both interlayer coupling and the presence of clean IPs have been proposed as key factors enhancing superconductivity, their individual roles have been difficult to disentangle, as IPs and OPs typically become superconducting simultaneously. Here we investigate five-layer (Cu,C)Ba2Ca4Cu5Oy (Cu1245) with Tc = 78 K and three-layer Ba2Ca2Cu3O6(F,O)2 (F0223) with Tc = 100 K using ARPES, and uncover an unprecedented situation, in which only the IPs become superconducting while the OPs remain metallic at low temperatures. Model calculations indicate that more than 95% of the OP wavefunction remains confined to OP itself, with minimal hybridization from the superconducting IPs. In particular, we experimentally realize an ideal configuration: a single superconducting CuO2 layer sandwiched between heavily overdoped metallic outer layers, which screen disorder originating from the dopant layers. Strikingly, this clean CuO2 layer exhibits the largest superconducting gap among all known cuprates and coherent Bogoliubov peaks extending beyond the antiferromagnetic zone boundary -- long regarded as the boundary beyond which coherence vanishes in heavily underdoped cuprates. Furthermore, a widely extended coherent flat band emerges at the Brillouin zone edge, overcoming the pseudogap damping effect. Our results introduce a new physical parameter, the degree of screening, to investigate the competition between superconductivity and the pseudogap, potentially shedding new light on its origin. The nearly disorder-free superconducting CuO2 layers offer a model platform for bridging the gap between disordered real materials and idealized theoretical models, which generally neglect disorder effects.",

The method exploits the power of anyon condensation in Choi states and is applicable to the cases where the target states arise from pure-state topological phases subject to strong decoherence/disorders in the Abelian sectors. Representative examples include $m^a e^b$ decoherence of $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, decohered non-Abelian $S_3$ quantum double as well as pure $Z$/$X$ decoherence of arbitrary CSS codes. An example of chiral topological phases which cannot arise from local commuting projector models are also presented.",

The goal is to encode classical information directly to the quantum state so that it is possible to leverage quantum algorithms for data processing. However, quantum state preparation of arbitrary states scales exponentially in the number of two-qubit gates, and this makes quantum state preparation a very difficult task on quantum computers, especially on near-term noisy devices. This represents a major challenge in achieving quantum advantage. We present and analyze a novel two-step state preparation method where we first minimize the entanglement entropy of the target quantum state, thus transforming the state to one that is easier to prepare. The state with reduced entanglement entropy is then represented as a matrix product state, resulting in a high accuracy preparation of the target state. Our method is suitable for NISQ devices and we give rigorous lower bounds on the accuracy of the prepared state in terms of the entanglement entropy and demonstrate cutting-edge performance across a collection of benchmark states.",

In this work, we study the training dynamics of Matrix Product State (MPS) classifiers applied to three-class problems, using both fashion MNIST and hyper-spectral satellite imagery as representative datasets. We investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where generalization emerges suddenly after memorization, by tracking entanglement entropy, local magnetization, and model performance across training sweeps. Additionally, we employ information theory tools to gain deeper insights: transfer entropy is used to reveal causal dependencies between label-specific quantum masks, while O-information captures the shift from synergistic to redundant correlations among class outputs. Our results show that grokking in the fashion MNIST task coincides with a sharp entanglement transition and a peak in redundant information, whereas the overfitted hyper-spectral model retains synergistic, disordered behavior. These findings highlight the relevance of high-order information dynamics in quantum-inspired learning and emphasize the distinct learning behaviors that emerge in multi-class classification, offering a principled framework to interpret generalization in quantum machine learning architectures.",

    "summary": "Spin pumping with superconductors has been extensively studied, particularly in double-layer systems. In this study, we investigate spin pumping in a trilayer system comprising a ferromagnetic insulator (FMI), a superconductor (SC), and a normal metal (NM). We derive the AC and DC spin currents in the NM layer induced by spin motion in the FMI under circularly polarized microwave irradiation. If we treat the spin motion as classical, the AC spin current is expressed. On the other hand, if we treat the spin motion as quantum quasiparticles, the DC spin current is derived. After these derivations, while the computational cost of evaluating the spin current is extremely high, we mitigate this using the Quantics Tensor Cross Interpolation (QTCI) method. We present numerical results showing the dependence of the spin current on temperature, microwave frequency, and superconductor layer thickness. Notably, the temperature dependence of AC and DC spin currents exhibits a coherence peak. Furthermore, we have discovered a transition structure in the dependence of the spin current on the thickness of the superconductor layer, where the dependence changes after a particular frequency.",

This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.",

    "summary": "The simulation of quantum field theories, both classical and quantum, requires regularization of infinitely many degrees of freedom. However, in the context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$ discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter $N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example, we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different $N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\\textit{field digitization scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension $\\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\\chi$ and $N$. Finally, we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the ground state of a (2+1)D $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum limit of digitized quantum field theories.",

    "summary": "Solids in an intense laser field show high-harmonic generation (HHG), which can provide information on carrier dynamics and band structures in weakly correlated systems. In strongly correlated systems, a laser field can induce a transition between the various electronic phases formed by the entanglement of charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom via carrier generation. The HHG accompanying this process should contain information on the nonequilibrium electronic-state dynamics along the oscillating field - an aspect that remains unresolved to date. Here, we show that an intense mid-infrared (MIR) pulse induces a Mott insulator-metal transition in a one-dimensional cuprate, Sr2CuO3, the evolution of which is reflected by the spectral features of HHs. When the electric-field amplitude exceeds 6 MV/cm, carriers are efficiently generated and each harmonic frequency decreases from odd multiples of the MIR frequency. Dynamical mean-field theory indicates that these redshifts originate from a series of electronic-structure reconstructions in each electric-field cycle during the melting of the Mott-insulator state, which modifies the radiation phase from carrier recombination cycle-by-cycle. This phenomenon is negligible in rigid-band systems. This experimental-theoretical study confirms that HH spectroscopy research can potentially unravel the sub-cycle dynamics of nonequilibrium phase transitions in correlated materials.",

    "summary": "Plasma etching, a critical process in semiconductor fabrication, utilizes hydrofluorocarbons both as etchants and as precursors for carbon film formation, where precise control over film growth is essential for achieving high SiO$_2$/Si$_3$N$_4$ selectivity and enabling atomic layer etching. In this work, we develop neural network potentials (NNPs) to gain atomistic insights into the surface evolution of SiO$_2$ and Si$_3$N$_4$ under hydrofluorocarbon ion bombardment. To efficiently sample diverse local configurations without exhaustive enumeration of ion-substrate combinations, we propose a vapor-to-surface sampling approach using high-temperature, low-density molecular dynamics simulations, supplemented with baseline reference structures. The NNPs, refined through iterative training, yield etching characteristics in MD simulations that show good agreement with experimental results. Further analysis reveals distinct mechanisms of carbon layer formation in SiO$_2$ and Si$_3$N$_4$, driven by the higher volatility of carbon-oxygen byproducts in SiO$_2$ and the suppressed formation of volatile carbon-nitrogen species in Si$_3$N$_4$. This computational framework enables quantitative predictions of atomistic surface modifications under plasma exposure and provides a foundation for integration with multiscale process modeling, offering insights into semiconductor fabrication processes.",

Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations.

They nevertheless give unprecedented access to programmable quantum systems that can efficiently, although imperfectly, simulate quantum time evolutions. Dynamical mean field theory, on the other hand, maps strongly-correlated lattice models like the Hubbard model onto simpler, yet still many-body models called impurity models. Its computational bottleneck boils down to investigating the dynamics of the impurity upon addition or removal of one particle. This task is notoriously difficult for classical algorithms, which has warranted the development of specific classical algorithms called \"impurity solvers\" that work well in some regimes, but still struggle to reach some parameter regimes. In these lecture notes, we introduce the tools and methods of quantum computing that could be used to overcome the limitations of these classical impurity solvers, either in the long term -- with fully quantum algorithms, or in the short term -- with hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.",

    "summary": "Chiral crystals, due to the lack of inversion and mirror symmetries, exhibit unique spin responses to external fields, enabling physical effects rarely observed in high-symmetry systems. Here, we show that materials from the chiral dichalcogenide family TM$_3$X$_6$ (T = 3d, M = 4d/5d, X = S) exhibit persistent spin texture (PST) - unidirectional spin polarization of states across large regions of the reciprocal space - in their nonmagnetic metallic phase. Using the example of NiTa$_{3}$S$_{6}$ and NiNb$_{3}$S$_{6}$, we show that PSTs cover the full Fermi surface, a rare and desirable feature that enables efficient charge-to-spin conversion and suggests long spin lifetimes and coherent spin transport above magnetic ordering temperatures. At low temperatures, the materials that order antiferromagnetically become chiral altermagnets, where spin textures originating from spin-orbit coupling and altermagnetism combine in a way that sensitively depends on the orientation of the Neel vector. Using symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we classify magnetic ground states across the family, identify cases with weak ferromagnetism, and track the evolution of spin textures and charge-to-spin conversion across magnetic phases and different Neel vector orientations, revealing spin transport signatures that allow one to distinguish Neel vector directions. These findings establish TM$_3$X$_6$ as a tunable platform for efficient charge-to-spin conversion and spin transport, combining structural chirality, persistent spin textures, and altermagnetism.",

Altermagnets, a class of magnetic systems integrating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic features, host multipolar orders in addition to dipolar Neel order. In this work, we demonstrate the multipole Hall effect in d-wave altermagnets--a transverse flow of multipole moments induced by an electric field. Using symmetry analysis and linear response theory, we show that the magnetic octupole Hall effect persists even in symmetries where the spin-splitter effect is forbidden and thus provides a robust experimental signature. In addition, we identify a sizable electric quadrupole Hall effect, originating from quadrupole splittings in the band structure. Our results expand the family of Hall effects to include higher-order multipolar responses and establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for exploring multipole transport beyond spin and orbital degrees of freedom.",

In the limit of weak interaction strengths ($\\Delta$), a naive application of Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) predicts an $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta^{2})$ quasiparticle decay rate. However, for 1d fermions on the lattice at $T>0$, this calculation gives a divergent result and the scaling of the quasiparticle lifetime with interaction strength remains an open question. In this work we propose a solution to this question: combining numerical simulations using the recently introduced dissipation-assisted operator evolution (DAOE) method, with non-perturbative diagrammatic re-summations, we predict a logarithmic enhancement of the quasiparticle decay rate $\\tau^{-1} \\sim \\Delta^{2} \\log \\Delta^{-2}$. We argue that this effect is present in a wide variety of well-known weakly interacting quantum fermionic and bosonic systems, and even in some classical systems, provided the non-interacting limit has quasiparticles with a generic dispersion.",

    "summary": "In ultrafast experiments on superconductors, a pump laser pulse often heats up the electronic system and suppresses the density of superfluid electrons. Subsequently, the electrons undergo a cooling process due to electron-phonon thermalization so that the superfluid density recovers in time. We show that if a supercurrent is initiated by a probe pulse in the cooling process, an intriguing phenomenon of 'supercurrent amplification' occurs, meaning that the net current grows in time with the increasing superfluid density. Using the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we uncover its microscopic origin as the momentum-relaxing scattering of quasi-particles by impurities and phonons, in stark contrast to the widely accepted intuition that impurities always attenuate currents. We further show that supercurrent amplification has important experimental manifestations, including the ultrafast Meissener effect and an optical reflectivity exceeding unity.",

    "summary": "Epitaxial strain in transition-metal oxides can induce dramatic changes in electronic and magnetic properties. A recent study on the epitaxially strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films revealed persistent ferromagnetism even across a metal-insulator transition. This challenges the current theoretical predictions, and the nature of the local spin state underlying this robustness remains unresolved. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Co-$L_3$ edge to probe the spin states of strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films. Compared with CoO$_6$ cluster multiplet calculations, we identify a ground state composed of a mixed high- and low-spin configuration, distinct from the previously proposed intermediate-spin state. Our results demonstrate that the robustness of ferromagnetism arises from the interplay between this mixed spin state and the presence of ligand holes associated with negative charge transfer. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for a nontrivial magnetic ground state in SrCoO$_3$ and offer new pathways for designing robust ferromagnetic systems in correlated oxides.",

Through explicit calculations of experimentally measurable quantities, we show that a simple two-component fermion model (TCFM) representing electron fractionalization succeeds in reproducing various detailed features of these experimental data: ARPES and QPI data are concomitantly reproduced by the TCFM in full energy and momentum spaces. The measured QPI pattern reveals a signature characteristic of the TCFM, distinct from the conventional single-component prediction, supporting the validity of the electron fractionalization in the cuprate. The integrated analysis also solves the puzzles of ARPES and QPI data that are seemingly inconsistent with each other. The overall success of the TCFM offers a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates. We further predict that a characteristic QPI pattern should appear in the unoccupied high-energy part if the fractionalization is at work. We propose that integrated-spectroscopy analyses offer a promising way to explore challenging issues of strongly correlated electron systems.",

This ansatz can be exploited to study quantum phases observed in a large class of systems realizable in such experimental platforms and is useful to study quantum dynamics. We show that the relaxation dynamics of various out-of-equilibrium initial states under sudden quench of Hamiltonian parameters can be studied with this ansatz wavefunction within the framework of time-dependent variational principle.

    "summary": "The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered tin termination with a varying density of surface tin-vacancies. Finally, we show how a combination of algorithmic and machine learning analysis of photoemission data can be used to extract identifying features, classify spatial regions, and correlate local chemistry with local electronic structure.",

    "summary": "The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an efficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign problem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow time can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped Hubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of this parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original integration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature that facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time modest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes increasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential ergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the Generalized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC updates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from ergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the Boltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed region. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to be larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions where ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be embedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the pure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within statistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \\times 6$ spatial lattice at $T/\\kappa = 1/6.4\\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\\kappa = 8.0$ with Trotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\\kappa$: hopping parameter).",

While equilibrium properties are well understood through methods like the numerical renormalization group and density matrix renormalization group, nonequilibrium transport remains a major theoretical challenge. From the experimental point of view, recent advances in nanofabrication and measurement techniques have enabled the investigation of far-from-equilibrium regimes. These conditions give rise to new transport phenomena, where strong correlations and nonequilibrium dynamics interplay in complex ways; beyond the reach of conventional linear response theory. To meet these challenges, new approaches such as nonequilibrium Green's functions, real-time NRG, and time-dependent DMRG have emerged. This work reviews the established results for quantum dot transport in and beyond the linear regime, highlights recent theoretical and experimental advances, and discusses open problems and future prospects.",

    "summary": "Schmidt decomposition of a vector can be understood as writing the singular value decomposition (SVD) in vector form. A vector can be written as a linear combination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively applying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector expressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$ principal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore, writing a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of the vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based denoising.   In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$ (determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the training sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire datasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network head to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the quantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional probability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and potentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training large-scale models. We use datasets provided in the Python scikit-learn module for the experiments. The results confirm the quantum circuit is able to compress data successfully to provide effective $k$-rank approximations to the classical processing component.",

Upon varying the Hubbard-U term on the edge we observe a boundary phase transition from an ordinary phase with a helical Luttinger liquid edge decoupled from the critical bulk to an extraordinary-log phase characterized by a logarithmically diverging spin stiffness.

Integrating Berry curvature over the momentum domain for the gapped spectra yields well-defined and quantized Chern numbers, enabling a systematic classification of them across interaction types. These topological invariants remain robust under deformation parameters like interaction and temperature, indicating that H-MFT encodes effective single-particle-state topology near a quantum critical point in strongly correlated systems.

We show that a quantum-Hall trilayer at $\\nu_{1}=\\nu_{2}=\\nu_{3}= \\frac13$, tuned solely by the inter-layer spacing $d$, realizes this goal. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations and a Chern-Simons field theory analysis reveal an intermediate ``anyon-exciton condensate'' separating the familiar $\\nu_{\\mathrm{tot}}=1$ exciton condensate ($d \\to 0$) from three decoupled Laughlin liquids ($d \\to \\infty$). In this phase, neutral bi-excitons condense while a $\\nu=\\frac23$ Laughlin topological order survives, yielding a Goldstone mode coexisting with fractionalized anyons. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis maps out the finite-temperature phase diagram. The anyon-exciton condensate can be experimentally verified through a vanishing double-counter-flow resistance and a fractional layer-resolved Hall resistivity $R_{xy}=\\frac{5}{2} h/e^{2}$, both within reach of existing high-mobility trilayer devices.",

    "summary": "The emergence of high transition temperature (Tc) superconductivity in strongly correlated materials remains a major unsolved problem in physics. High-Tc materials, such as cuprates, are generally complex and not easily tunable, making theoretical modelling difficult. Although the Hubbard model--a simple theoretical model of interacting electrons on a lattice--is believed to capture the essential physics of high-Tc materials, obtaining accurate solutions of the model, especially in the relevant regime of moderate correlation, is challenging. The recent demonstration of robust superconductivity in moir\\'e WSe2, whose low-energy electronic bands can be described by the Hubbard model and are highly tunable, presents a new platform for tackling the high-Tc problem. Here, we tune moir\\'e WSe2 bilayers to the moderate correlation regime through the twist angle and map the phase diagram around one hole per moir\\'e unit cell (v = 1) by electrostatic gating and electrical transport and magneto-optical measurements. We observe a range of high-Tc phenomenology, including an antiferromagnetic insulator at v = 1, superconducting domes upon electron and hole doping, and unusual metallic states at elevated temperatures including strange metallicity. The highest Tc occurs adjacent to the Mott transition, reaching about 6% of the effective Fermi temperature. Our results establish a new material system based on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\\'e superlattices that can be used to study high-Tc superconductivity in a highly controllable manner and beyond.",

We demonstrate the potential of this tool with four separate case study applications to real material systems: 1) discontinuous structural phase transitions in pseudobrookites; 2) homological structure classification; 3) structure-correlated piezoelectricity in hexagonal materials; and 4) superconducting materials design in the cuprate family.

This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a continuous parameter $\\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between bosonic ($\\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as special cases. By combining reweighting and $\\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches. Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation in strongly interacting fermionic systems.",

In this work, we investigate the application of variational Monte Carlo and neural network wavefunction representations to examine their ground-state (the eigenstate with the smallest real part energy) properties. Due to the breakdown of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle in non-Hermitian settings, we develop a self-consistent symmetric optimization framework based on variance minimization with a dynamically updated energy estimate. Our approach respects the biorthogonal structure of left and right eigenstates, and is further strengthened by exploiting system symmetries and pseudo-Hermiticity. Tested on a two-dimensional non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model endowed with a complex longitudinal field, our method achieves high accuracy across both parity-time symmetric and broken phases. Moreover, we propose novel optimization routines that address the challenges posed by exceptional points and provide reliable convergence to the ground state in regimes where standard variational techniques fail. Lastly, we show, through extensive numerical evidence, that our method offers a scalable and flexible computational tool to investigate non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems, beyond the reach of conventional numerical techniques such as the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm.",

    "summary": "Understanding how complex quantum systems emulate randomness is central to quantum chaos, thermalization, and information theory. In one setting, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe asymptotic freeness between Heisenberg operators: the non-commutative generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct research direction, the concept of approximate unitary designs have led to efficient constructions of unitaries that look random according to forward-in-time protocols. Bridging these two concepts, in this work we study the emergence of freeness from a random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely the observables that lead to thermal correlations in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The RMPU ensemble provably forms a unitary design, but, we argue, this does not account for average OTOC behavior and therefore the emergence of freeness. We further compute the ensemble's frame potential exactly to second order, showing convergence to Haar values also with polynomial deviations, indicating that freeness is also reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand, to reproduce the Haar-like OTOC value for local, traceless observables, the considered ensemble requires volume-law operator entanglement. Such correlations therefore lie beyond the paradigm of random unitary features which can be replicated efficiently. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary designs in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for genuine quantum advantage while shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.",

    "summary": "This article reviews theoretical methods for analyzing Floquet engineering (FE) phenomena in open (dissipative) quantum or classical systems, with an emphasis on our recent results. In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum systems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum systems, that is based on the Schr\\\"odinger equation. However, if we consider the FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but finite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is inevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative systems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show that a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the balance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to the bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet theory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation of motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied only to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution function of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can arrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence of the Floquet theory for classical systems. On top of fundamentals of the Floquet theory, we review representative examples of FEs (Floquet topological insulators, inverse Faraday effects in metals and magnets, Kapitza pendulum, etc.) and dissipation-assisted FEs.",

    "summary": "Conventional machine learning approaches accelerate inorganic materials design via accurate property prediction and targeted material generation, yet they operate as single-shot models limited by the latent knowledge baked into their training data. A central challenge lies in creating an intelligent system capable of autonomously executing the full inorganic materials discovery cycle, from ideation and planning to experimentation and iterative refinement. We introduce SparksMatter, a multi-agent AI model for automated inorganic materials design that addresses user queries by generating ideas, designing and executing experimental workflows, continuously evaluating and refining results, and ultimately proposing candidate materials that meet the target objectives. SparksMatter also critiques and improves its own responses, identifies research gaps and limitations, and suggests rigorous follow-up validation steps, including DFT calculations and experimental synthesis and characterization, embedded in a well-structured final report. The model's performance is evaluated across case studies in thermoelectrics, semiconductors, and perovskite oxides materials design. The results demonstrate the capacity of SparksMatter to generate novel stable inorganic structures that target the user's needs. Benchmarking against frontier models reveals that SparksMatter consistently achieves higher scores in relevance, novelty, and scientific rigor, with a significant improvement in novelty across multiple real-world design tasks as assessed by a blinded evaluator. These results demonstrate SparksMatter's unique capacity to generate chemically valid, physically meaningful, and creative inorganic materials hypotheses beyond existing materials knowledge.",

Here, we show that the Markov length diverges even under classical stochastic dynamics, when a low-temperature ordered state is quenched into the high temperature phase. Conventional observables do not exhibit growing length scales upon quenching into the high-temperature phase; however, the Markov length grows exponentially in time. Consequently, the state of a system as it heats becomes increasingly non-Gibbsian, and the range of its putative \"parent Hamiltonian\" must diverge with the Markov length. From this information-theoretic point of view the late-time limit of thermalization is singular. We introduce a numerical technique for computing the Markov length based on matrix-product states, and explore its dynamics under general thermal quenches in the one-dimensional classical Ising model. For all cases, we provide simple information-theoretic arguments that explain our results.",

    "summary": "High-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics. While early samples exhibited limited superconducting volume fractions, Pr substitution for La enabled bulk superconductivity in polycrystals under pressure and enhanced transition temperatures in thin films at ambient pressure. Beyond rare-earth doping, moderate oxygen or ozone annealing improves superconductivity by mitigating oxygen vacancies, whereas high-pressure oxygen annealing leads to a trivial, non-superconducting metallic state across all pressure regimes. These findings highlight the need to elucidate both the individual and combined effects of Pr doping and oxygen stoichiometry in modulating superconductivity in bilayer nickelates. Here, using multislice electron ptychography and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ and high-pressure-oxygen-annealed La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_{7+\\delta}$ polycrystals. We find that Pr dopants preferentially occupy outer La sites, effectively eliminating inner-apical oxygen vacancies and ensuring near-stoichiometry in as-grown La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$ that is bulk-superconducting under pressure. In contrast, high-pressure oxygen annealing induces a striped interstitial oxygen order, introducing quasi-1D lattice potentials and excess hole carriers into p-d hybridized orbitals, ultimately suppressing superconductivity. This behavior starkly contrasts with cuprate superconductors, where similar interstitial oxygen ordering enhances superconductivity instead. Our findings reveal a competition between striped interstitial oxygen order and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, offering key insights into their distinct pairing mechanisms and providing a roadmap for designing more robust superconducting phases.",

When the hopping integral and the on-site potential of the fermions depend on the direction of the link spins, the low-energy effective theory predicts that the link spins behave as a dynamical axion field in 1+1 dimensions. The axion field $\\theta$ is coupled to the electric field $E$ as $\\theta E$, through which the link spins rotate in response to the applied electric field or the chemical potential gradient for charge-neutral fermions. This is the inverse phenomenon of Thouless pumping in the Rice-Mele model. After analyzing the dynamics by approximating the link spins with the classical ones and utilizing the axion Lagrangian, we show the full-quantum dynamics using the tensor network method. Even though we do not explicitly introduce the axion Lagrangian in solving the fermion-spin coupled many-body dynamics, the full-quantum results agree well with those with the classical spin approximation, including the dynamics of the axion field and fermion transport. In addition, we find that the quantum correlation between spins accelerates the dynamics of axion fields as the suppression of the expectation values of the link spins allows them to rotate easily. We also propose a possible experimental setup for cold-atomic systems to implement the Hamiltonian in this study.",

    "summary": "Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.",

    "summary": "FeSe has been one of the most intensively studied iron-based superconductors over the past two decades, exhibiting a wide range of phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, nematic order, magnetism, orbital-selective correlations, and structural phase transitions. While topologically non-trivial phases have been identified in certain cases - such as Te-doped FeSe and monolayer FeSe - topology in bulk FeSe has largely remained unexplored. In this work, we propose a new route to realize topological phases directly in bulk FeSe. We demonstrate that breaking the in-plane $C_4$ rotational symmetry, thereby lowering the crystal symmetry, can drive FeSe into a strong topological insulating phase. To support this, we perform density functional theory calculations and analyze the band structure using topological quantum chemistry and symmetry-based indicators. Our results show that both uniaxial strain and the structural transition to the orthorhombic low-temperature phase lead to non-trivial band topology. Moreover, incorporating electronic correlations through dynamical mean field theory reveals that the topological characteristics near the Fermi level remain robust, as the relevant bands experience only moderate renormalization. These findings highlight strain as a promising mechanism to induce topological phases in FeSe.",

    "summary": "Because it is easily switched from insulator to metal either via chemical doping or electrical gating, silicon is at the core of modern information technology and remains a candidate platform for quantum computing. The metal-to-insulator transition in this material has therefore been one of the most studied phenomena in condensed matter physics, and has been revisited with considerable profit each time a new fabrication technology has been introduced. Here we take advantage of recent advances in creating ultra-thin layers of Bohr-atom-like dopants to realize the two-dimensional disordered Hubbard model at half-filling and its metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) as a function of mean distance between atoms. We use gas-phase dosing of dopant precursor molecules on silicon to create arsenic and phosphorus $\\delta$-layers as thin as 0.4~nm and as dilute as 10$^{13}$~cm$^{-2}$. On approaching the insulating state, the conventional weak localization effects, prevalent at high dopant densities and due to orbital motion of the electrons in the plane, become dominated by electron-electron interaction contributions which obey a paramagnetic Zeeman scaling law. The latter make a negative contribution to the conductance, and thus cannot be interpreted in terms of an emergent Kondo regime near the MIT.",

This review aims to discuss different principles of AI-driven generative models that are applicable for materials discovery, including different materials representations available for this purpose. We will also highlight specific applications of generative models in designing new catalysts, semiconductors, polymers, or crystals while addressing challenges such as data scarcity, computational cost, interpretability, synthesizability, and dataset biases. Emerging approaches to overcome limitations and integrate AI with experimental workflows will be discussed, including multimodal models, physics informed architectures, and closed-loop discovery systems.

Their physics is thus established by a complex interplay between the transition-metal (TM)-ligand hopping $t$, charge transfer energy $\\Delta_\\mathrm{CT}$, and on-site TM Hubbard repulsion $U$. Here, we study the spectral properties of a one-dimensional (1D) analog of such a $pd$ system, with alternating TM $d$ and ligand anion $p$ orbitals situated along a chain. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we study the model's single-particle spectral function, x-ray absorption spectrum, and dynamical spin structure factor as a function of $\\Delta_\\mathrm{CT}$ and $U$. In particular, we present results spanning from the Mott insulating ($\\Delta_\\mathrm{CT} > U$) to negative charge transfer regime $\\Delta_\\mathrm{CT} < 0$ to better understand the ground and momentum-resolved excited state properties of these different regimes. Our results can guide new studies on TMOs that seek to situate them within the Mott-Hubbard/charge transfer insulator classification scheme.",

To address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train (TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.",

In this study, we investigate two UQ strategies, ensemble learning and D-optimality, within the atomic cluster expansion framework. It is revealed that higher model accuracy strengthens the correlation between predicted uncertainties and actual errors and improves novelty detection, with D-optimality yielding more conservative estimates. Both methods deliver well calibrated uncertainties on homogeneous training sets, yet they underpredict errors and exhibit reduced novelty sensitivity on heterogeneous datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce clustering-enhanced local D-optimality, which partitions configuration space into clusters during training and applies D-optimality within each cluster. This approach substantially improves the detection of novel atomic environments in heterogeneous datasets. Our findings clarify the roles of model fidelity and data heterogeneity in UQ performance and provide a practical route to robust active learning and adaptive sampling strategies for MLIP development.",

Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.",

    "summary": "A thorough study of the wide-range (40-35000 cm-1) dynamic conductivity and permittivity spectra of the archetypal heavy fermion metal CeB6 and unconventional superconductor ZrB12 was carried out at room temperature. Both the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations were separated and analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 was attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the boron complexes in CeB6 and ZrB12. It was shown that nonequilibrium electrons participating in the formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and fraction of Drude-type electrons does not exceed 37% in CeB6 and 23% in ZrB12. We discuss also the additional Drude-type component in ZrB12 in terms of far-infrared conductivity from the sliding charge density wave, and suggest the localized mode scenario reconciles the strong difference between the number of conduction electrons obtained from the Hall effect and optical sum rule analysis in CeB6.",

    "summary": "Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are still in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques remains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the meanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum circuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical processor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor executes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and expressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant message-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid quantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties of liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the message-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations driven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature structural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings demonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could deliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative, suggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials modeling.",

Using the polarization-resolved momentum space selectivity of Raman scattering, we track the superconducting condensate destruction and recovery with sub-ps resolution in the anti-nodal region of the Fermi surface where the superconducting gap is maximum. Leveraging ultrafast Raman thermometry, we find a significant dichotomy between the superconducting condensate and the quasiparticle temperature dynamics near the anti-nodes, which cannot be framed in terms of a single effective electron temperature. The present work demonstrates the ability of TR-Raman to selectively probe out-of-equilibrium pathways of different electron sub-degrees of freedom during a photoinduced phase transition.",

To span a bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections, fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and machine learning of topological quantum order.",

To study this setup, pertaining to boundary criticality, we consider a model exhibiting a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a dynamically generated quantum spin Hall state (i.e.a topological Mott insulator) and an s-wave superconductor. For the topological Mott insulator, the bulk Goldstone modes are shown to be irrelevant at the helical Luttinger liquid fixed points. The deconfined quantum critical point is an instance of an emergent anomaly, and we observe a sharp localized edge state at this point. The sharpness of the edge mode is consistent with an ordinary phase in which electronic edge modes decouple from critical edge bosonic fluctuations. At the DQCP, the scaling dimension of the edge electron shows a jump, a feature argued to be a signature of the emergent anomaly. Our results are based on large-scale auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations.We also carry out calculations for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model to confirm spectral features of the ordinary and extraordinary-log phases in the vicinity of the bulk critical point.",

We define RIXS-CD as the difference between scattering amplitudes for the right- and left-circularly polarized incoming photons and unpolarized (total) outgoing photons. We employ the impurity approximation, in which the interference between scattering events on different atoms is neglected. We perform the symmetry analysis of several common antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic structures and outline the general approach. The analysis is supported by numerical calculations using atomic model with realistic crystal fields obtained from first principles. We show that RIXS-CD is distinguished from first-order spectroscopies such as x-ray magnetic circular dichroism by insensitivity to the time-reversal symmetry breaking. As a result we find that RIXS-CD is present in the normal (disordered) state of materials with lower symmetry. In antiferromagnets the RIXS-CD is invariant under N\\'eel vector reversal. In altermagnets and ferromagnets the RIXS-CD spectra for time-reversed states are, in general, independent except for the special case when there is a unitary symmetry of the Hamiltonian connecting the",

We represent the nanosystem by means of a cluster Hubbard model, which allows us to study scenarios when the tunneling electrons sequentially interact with several magnetic centers inside the nanosystem or when the magnetic centers are made out of heavy atoms with a strong spin-orbit coupling and large orbital moments. The sequential tunneling through multiple centers is illustrated on an adatom probed by an STM tip with a nickelocene molecule attached to it. For atoms with a large orbital moment, we find the transitions accessible by IETS to be governed by the selection rule $\\Delta J_z\\leq 2\\ell+1$, where $J_z$ is the projection of the total angular momentum of the atom to the quantization axis and $\\ell$ is the orbital momentum quantum number of the partially filled atomic shell carrying the magnetic moment.

    "summary": "Chiral inorganic crystals with topological characteristics, prized for their exotic properties and fundamental interest, remain scarce in existing database. This work establishes a viable route for their large-scale discovery by integrating universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) for high-throughput structure optimization with the broad exploration capability of Random Structure Search (RSS). We implemented this combined uMLIP-RSS workflow to perform massive variable-composition crystal structure prediction across ternary systems, specifically targeting chiral space groups. High-throughput uMLIP-based optimization and stability screening of over 20 million randomly generated chiral structures identified numerous potentially stable phases out of existing database. Subsequent validation by first-principles confirmed over 120 new chiral inorganic crystals with promising functional applications, including topological characteristics, nonlinear optics, and superconductivity. Notably, this set includes materials exhibiting remarkable quantum phenomena, such as the nonlinear Hall effect driven by berry curvature dipole, quantum metric and symmetry-enforced six-fold topological points, long Fermi arcs and large magnetoresistance. This work substantially expands the pool of chiral functional materials and demonstrates a scalable, efficient strategy for predictive discovery in complex materials.",

    "summary": "The Lieb lattice, originally proposed for cuprate superconductors, has gained new attention in the emerging field of altermagnetism as a minimal analytical model for the latter. While initially the so-called inverse Lieb lattice (ILL) was deemed only a theoretical model, recently several real materials with this crystallographic motif have been found. The unique geometry of ILL can accommodate complex magnetic orderings arising from competing exchange interactions and geometric frustration, offering great tunability for magnetic properties. In this work, we provide comprehensive insights into magnetic phases in ILL materials and establish guidelines for efficient identification of altermagnetic materials within this family. We begin by constructing phase diagrams using a simple Heisenberg model to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying altermagnetism and other complex magnetic phases observed experimentally. To bridge theory with experiment, we systematically investigate a series of existing ILL compounds using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine their magnetic ground states. Our computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, we identify a trend linking magnetic ordering to the $d$-shell filling of transition metal ions, with $d^{2-3}$ and $d^{5}$ configurations showing propensity for altermagnetic behavior. Additionally, we identify a promising metallic compound Sr$_{2}$CrO$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$OAs$_{2}$ as an altermagnet that is highly anisotropic in its $J_2$ exchange couplings with large N\\'eel temperature ($\\sim 600$ K). Using exchange coupling parameters extracted from DFT calculations, we compute the magnon spectra for altermagnetic systems. As expected, chiral splittings in the magnon dispersion are directly correlated with anisotropy between crystallographically inequivalent $J_{2}$ exchange interactions.",

In this study, we probe the evolution of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial all-oxide LSMO (12 nm)/NNO (4, 8, and 16 nm) bilayers. Using spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance we track the spin-charge conversion in the NNO layer through the paramagnetic metal to antiferromagnetic insulator transition and observe a pronounced enhancement of the inverse spin Hall effect signal at the onset of this transition. We attribute this enhancement to the electronic and magnetic disorder in NNO at the first-order phase transition, thereby providing insights into the mechanism of spin transport through the phase transition. The tunability of spin charge conversion in this low damping bilayer system offers a pathway for developing multifunctional, energy-efficient spintronic devices.",

Within a four-site tight-binding model, which can be tuned between an antiferromagnetic and a Lieb-type altermagnetic state, we introduce on-site impurities at distinct sublattice sites and compute the real space local density of states (LDOS) via a Green's function approach. A Fourier transformation of the impurity-induced LDOS yields the characteristic $d$-wave spin-split Fermi surface contours of the altermagnetic phase. Notably, by choosing which sublattice the impurity is placed upon, we show that the scattering amplitudes effectively encode spin-dependent contrasts: Impurities on one of the magnetic sublattices highlights predominantly spin-up contributions along one crystallographic direction, while impurities on the other one favor the complementary spin-down channel and orientation.",

We present a novel framework that combines shadow tomography with modern time-series machine learning models to enable efficient and practical quantum phase classification. Our approach leverages the definition of quantum phases based on connectivity through finite-depth local unitary circuits, generating abundant training data by applying Haar random evolution to representative quantum states for a given phase. In this way, the training data can be efficiently obtained from a quantum simulator. Additionally, we demonstrate that advanced time-series models can be used to process the training data and achieve universal quantum phase classification that does not rely on local order parameters. To validate the universality and versatility of our method, we test the model against one-dimensional quantum spin chains such as the Ising model and the axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model, showing excellent agreement with known phase boundaries.",

We introduce a novel approach that allows to build hyperbolic tilings and their associated graph structure simultaneously, using only combinatoric rules without requiring an explicit coordinate representation. This allows to generate arbitrarily large, exact hyperbolic graphs, with an algorithmic complexity that does not depend on the lattice size. We provide an easy-to-use implementation which substantially outperforms existing methods, hence rendering ultra large-scale numerical simulations on these geometric structures accessible for the scientific community.",

While it is established that the system hosts a valence bond solid (VBS) phase for $J_d \\ge J_t$, the ground state phase diagram for $J_d < J_t$ has remained unsettled. Our iPEPS simulations uncover a first-order phase transition at $J_d/J_t \\approx 0.18$, significantly lower than previously reported estimates. Beyond this transition, we identify a close competition between two valence bond crystal (VBC) states: a columnar VBC and a $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ VBC, with the latter consistently exhibiting lower energy across all finite bond dimensions. The high-order series expansion supports this by finding that the $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ VBC state indeed becomes energetically favorable, but only at sixth order in perturbation theory, revealing the subtle nature of the competition between candidate states.",

Due to maximal possible correlations between any two selected subsystems these states have numerous applications in various fields of quantum information processing including multi-user teleportation, quantum error correction and secret sharing. We present an updated survey of various techniques to generate such strongly entangled states, including those going beyond the standard construction of graph and stabilizer states. Our contribution includes, in particular, analysis of the degree of entanglement of reduced states obtained by partial trace of AME projectors, states obtained by a symmetric superposition of GHZ states, an orthogonal frequency square representation of the \"golden\" AME state and an updated summary of the number of local unitary equivalence classes.",

    "summary": "Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.",

We have measured the thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{\\rm xx}$ and the thermal Hall conductivity $\\kappa_{\\rm xy}$ of three single crystals across a range of dopings. In the overdoped and optimally-doped samples, a clear enhancement is observed in both $\\kappa_{\\rm xx}$ and $\\kappa_{\\rm xy}$ upon cooling below the critical temperature $T_{\\rm c}$, due to a suppression of the inelastic electron-electron scattering as electrons condense into pairs. The underdoped sample shows no enhancement in either, pointing to a high degree of disorder in that sample. For the two highest dopings, the magnitude of the enhancement in $\\kappa_{\\rm xy}$ is controlled by the strength of the elastic impurity scattering. Using a prior model to estimate the mean free path from $\\kappa_{\\rm xy}$ data, we find that the mean free path in Bi2212 is approximately 7 times shorter than in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$, considered to be one of the least disordered cuprates. We conclude that the thermal Hall technique is a good way to compare the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in various cuprate materials.",

We investigate a one-dimensional spin-1 chain where quadrupolar order is promoted by two distinct mechanisms: conventional bilinear-biquadratic exchange and bond-directional antiferromagnetic Kitaev frustration. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations, we determine the complete ground-state phase diagram and uncover two emergent phases induced by the Kitaev interaction: a Kitaev nematic phase and a Kitaev-dimer phase. The Kitaev nematic phase emerges from a fragile biquadratic dimer state via a continuous quantum phase transition in the Ising universality class. The Kitaev dimer phase spontaneously breaks a screw symmetry to favor either $x$- or $y$-spin bonding, forming a gapped state that coexists with a crystalline order of alternating $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes.",

In this work, we apply matrix product state techniques to study the bosonic, non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall state, enabling precise numerical evaluation of both the full counting statistics and symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our results reveal an approximate equipartition of entanglement among symmetry sectors, consistent with theoretical expectations and subject to finite-size corrections. The results also show that these expectations for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy remain valid in the case of a non-Abelian state where the topological sectors cannot be distinguished by the Abelian $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry alone, and where neutral and charged modes possess distinct velocities. We additionally perform a detailed comparison of the entanglement spectrum with predictions from the Li-Haldane conjecture, finding remarkable agreement, and enabling a more precise understanding of the effects of the distinct neutral and charged velocities. This not only provides a stringent test of the conjecture but also highlights its explanatory power in understanding the origin and structure of finite-size effects across different symmetry sectors.",

The model can also be viewed as two-dimensional antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled usual ladders with AF rungs. We demonstrate that the dimer phase of the model, previously considered topologically trivial, is actually a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) Haldane phase belonging to a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state. This is established by measuring generalized strange correlators introduced in this work and further confirmed by showing that the nontrivial edge state on a zigzag cut in the dimer phase is ferromagnetically ordered, resulting from effective ferromagnetic interactions between degenerate spinons generated on each side of the zigzag cut. Furthermore, we show that the ordered edge state gives rise to an extraordinary surface critical behavior at the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) bulk critical points of the model, which contradicts theoretical predictions based on classical-quantum mapping.",

Our results showcase the ability of hybrid quantum tensor networks to achieve high accuracy in binary classification. Furthermore, we observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit in the encoding step.

    "summary": "Synthetic data generation is a key technique in modern artificial intelligence, addressing data scarcity, privacy constraints, and the need for diverse datasets in training robust models. In this work, we propose a method for generating privacy-preserving high-quality synthetic tabular data using Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS). We benchmark the MPS-based generative model against state-of-the-art models such as CTGAN, VAE, and PrivBayes, focusing on both fidelity and privacy-preserving capabilities. To ensure differential privacy (DP), we integrate noise injection and gradient clipping during training, enabling privacy guarantees via R\\'enyi Differential Privacy accounting. Across multiple metrics analyzing data fidelity and downstream machine learning task performance, our results show that MPS outperforms classical models, particularly under strict privacy constraints. This work highlights MPS as a promising tool for privacy-aware synthetic data generation. By combining the expressive power of tensor network representations with formal privacy mechanisms, the proposed approach offers an interpretable and scalable alternative for secure data sharing. Its structured design facilitates integration into sensitive domains where both data quality and confidentiality are critical.",

    "summary": "The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials science.",

    "summary": "Ionic mobility determines the rate performance of several applications, such as batteries, fuel cells, and electrochemical sensors and is exponentially dependent on the migration barrier ($E_m$), a difficult to measure/calculate quantity. Previous approaches to identify materials with high ionic mobility have relied on imprecise descriptors given the lack of generalizable models to predict $E_m$. Here, we present a graph neural network based architecture that leverages principles of transfer learning to efficiently and accurately predict $E_m$ across a diverse set of materials. We use a model pre-trained simultaneously on seven distinct bulk properties (labeled MPT), modify the MPT model to classify different migration pathways in a structure, and fine-tune (FT) on a manually-curated literature-derived dataset of 619 $E_m$ data points calculated with density functional theory. Importantly, our best-performing FT model (labeled MODEL-3) demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction accuracy compared to classical machine learning methods, graph models trained from scratch, and a universal machine learned interatomic potential, with a R$^2$ score of 0.703 and a mean absolute error of 0.261 eV on the test set. Notably, MODEL-3 is able to distinguish different migration pathways within a structure and also demonstrates excellent ability to generalize across intercalant compositions and chemistries. As a classifier, MODEL-3 exhibits 80\\% accuracy and 82.8\\% precision in identifying materials that are `good' ionic conductors (i.e., structures with $E_m <$0.65~eV). Thus, our work demonstrates the effective use of FT strategies and architectural modifications necessary for making swift and accurate $E_m$ predictions, which will be useful for materials discovery in batteries and for predicting other data-scarce material properties.",

Through a combination of quantum experiments, numerical calculations, and analytical methods, we demonstrate a rich set of phenomena accessible on such quantum simulators by studying an array of Rydberg atoms placed on the Lieb lattice. First, we map out the ground states and phase diagram of the system, identifying a range of density-wave-ordered phases,and find excellent agreement between theory and experiment. Allowing for local control of the detuning field thereafter, we discover a quantum analog of the classical liquid--vapor transition and probe its underlying hysteretic dynamics. Furthermore, we study out-of-equilibrium quantum quenches and observe anomalously slow relaxation dynamics arising from kinetic constraints. These results highlight how geometric control offered by neutral-atom simulators can extend the frontiers of programmable quantum matter, enabling access to complex phases, metastability, and thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems.",

However, storing and manipulating such distributions suffers from the curse of dimensionality, as memory and computational costs grow exponentially with dimension. Monte Carlo methods require thousands to billions of samples, incurring high computational costs and producing inconsistent results due to stochasticity. We present an efficient tensor train method for performing exact arithmetic operations on discretizations of continuous probability distributions while avoiding exponential growth. Our approach leverages low-rank tensor train decomposition to represent latent random variables compactly using Dirac deltas, enabling deterministic addition, subtraction and multiplication operations directly in the compressed format. We develop an efficient implementation using sparse matrices and specialized data structures that further enhances performance. Theoretical analysis demonstrates polynomial scaling of memory and computational complexity under rank assumptions, and shows how statistics of latent variables can be computed with polynomial complexity. Numerical experiments spanning randomized linear algebra to stochastic differential equations demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvements in memory usage and computational time compared to conventional approaches, enabling tractable deterministic computations on discretized random variables in previously intractable dimensions.",

    "summary": "Revealing the dynamic structural evolution and lithium transport properties during the charge/discharge processes is crucial for optimizing graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries, enabling high stability and fast-charging performance. However, the dynamic coupling mechanisms among carbon layer kinetics, lithium (de)intercalation/diffusion, and defects regulation remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we developed a universal automated workflow based on machine learning potentials to simulate the dynamic lithium (de)intercalation process. With this approach, the staging structural evolution of lithium-graphite intercalation compounds and their lithium transport behavior were resolved through molecular dynamics simulations. By introducing stacking faults into the graphite structure, we successfully simulated stage transitions driven by carbon layer sliding and reorganization, accompanied by stress release and structural stabilization. The dynamics of carbon layers regulate the lithium (de)intercalation positional selectivity, producing intermediate states with varying lithium concentrations and distributions during cycling. This facilitates the formation and transformation of stage structures while mitigating residual stress accumulation. A fundamental kinetic asymmetry arises between lithium intercalation and deintercalation, driven by the continuous and heterogeneous lithium transport and carbon layer sliding during charge/discharge processes. The carbon defects regulate lithium transport, in which the atomic-scale defects confine intralayer lithium transport and carbon sliding while enabling interlayer transport via dynamic lithium trapping/release mechanisms. Accordingly, for the future design, it is critical to construct structural units with controllable carbon layer sliding/reorganization, and tunable defects to enhance lithium-ion transport.",

    "summary": "Classical simulations of noisy quantum circuits is instrumental to our understanding of the behavior of real world quantum systems and the identification of regimes where one expects quantum advantage. In this work, we present a highly parallelizable tensor-network-based classical algorithm -- equipped with rigorous accuracy guarantees -- for simulating $n$-qubit quantum circuits with arbitrary single-qubit noise. Our algorithm represents the state of a noisy quantum system by a particular ensemble of matrix product states from which we stochastically sample. Each single qubit noise process acting on a pure state is then represented by the ensemble of states that achieve the minimal average entanglement (the entanglement of formation) between the noisy qubit and the remainder. This approach lets us use a more compact representation of the quantum state for a given accuracy requirement and noise level. For a given maximum bond dimension $\\chi$ and circuit, our algorithm comes with an upper bound on the simulation error, runs in poly$(n,\\chi)$-time and improves upon related prior work (1) in scope: by extending from the three commonly considered noise models to general single qubit noise (2) in performance: by employing a state-dependent locally-entanglement-optimal unraveling and (3) in conceptual contribution: by showing that the fixed unraveling used in prior work becomes equivalent to our choice of unraveling in the special case of depolarizing and dephasing noise acting on a maximally entangled state.",

Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.",

The foundation for constructing and validating accurate machine learning (ML) models that are capable of predicting $E_m$, and hence accelerating the discovery of novel electrodes and solid electrolytes, lies in the availability of high-quality dataset(s) containing $E_m$. Addressing this critical requirement, we present a comprehensive dataset comprising 619 distinct literature-reported $E_m$ values calculated using density functional theory based nudged elastic band computations, across 443 compositions and 27 structural groups consisting of various compounds that have been explored as electrodes or solid electrolytes in batteries. Our dataset includes compositions that correspond to fully charged and/or discharged states of electrode materials, with intermediate compositions incorporated in select instances. Crucially, for each compound, our dataset provides structural information, including the initial and final positions of the migrating ion, along with its corresponding $E_m$ in easy-to-use .xlsx and JSON formats. We envision our dataset to be a highly useful resource for the scientific community, facilitating the development of advanced ML models that can predict $E_m$ precisely and accelerate materials discovery.",

However, their evaluation has been limited to computational benchmarks that may not reflect real-world performance. Here, we present UniFFBench, a comprehensive framework for evaluating UMLFFs against experimental measurements of ~1,500 carefully curated mineral structures spanning diverse chemical environments, bonding types, structural complexity, and elastic properties. Our systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art UMLFFs reveals a substantial reality gap: models achieving impressive performance on computational benchmarks often fail when confronted with experimental complexity. Even the best-performing models exhibit higher density prediction error than the threshold required for practical applications. Most strikingly, we observe disconnects between simulation stability and mechanical property accuracy, with prediction errors correlating with training data representation rather than the modeling method. These findings demonstrate that while current computational benchmarks provide valuable controlled comparisons, they may overestimate model reliability when extrapolated to experimentally complex chemical spaces. Altogether, UniFFBench establishes essential experimental validation standards and reveals systematic limitations that must be addressed to achieve truly universal force field capabilities.",

Here, we propose tensor network variational diagonalization (TNVD), which encodes the full eigenenergy spectrum of a quantum many-body Hamiltonian into a matrix product state, and encodes the eigenstates as the evolutions of product states using variational quantum circuit (VQC). Thereby, TNVD reduces the computational complexity of diagonalization from exponential to polynomial in system size $N$. Numerical benchmarks up to $N=100$ spins are provided, which far surpass the computational limit of ED. We further consider quantum Ising model in a random field to reveal the underlying reliance between the efficiency of TNVD and entanglement properties of eigenstates. Typical signs, including the distribution of entanglement entropy (EE) versus eigenenergy and the density of state versus EE, are suggested to indicate area law of entanglement entropy or its violation, which are essential to the TNVD efficiency. Our work establishes TNVD as a powerful and scalable diagonalization approach for large-scale quantum many-body Hamiltonians. The incorporation of VQC lays a promising pathway to applying quantum computation to address the volume-law-EE Hamiltonians that lack efficient classical approaches.",

    "summary": "Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable atomistic simulations with near first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost, making them powerful tools for large-scale materials modeling. The accuracy of MLIPs is typically validated on a held-out dataset of \\emph{ab initio} energies and atomic forces. However, accuracy on these small-scale properties does not guarantee reliability for emergent, system-level behavior -- precisely the regime where atomistic simulations are most needed, but for which direct validation is often computationally prohibitive. As a practical heuristic, predictive precision -- quantified as inverse uncertainty -- is commonly used as a proxy for accuracy, but its reliability remains poorly understood, particularly for system-level predictions. In this work, we systematically assess the relationship between predictive precision and accuracy in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes, focusing on ensemble-based uncertainty quantification methods for neural network potentials, including bootstrap, dropout, random initialization, and snapshot ensembles. We use held-out cross-validation for ID assessment and calculate cold curve energies and phonon dispersion relations for OOD testing. These evaluations are performed across various carbon allotropes as representative test systems. We find that uncertainty estimates can behave counterintuitively in OOD settings, often plateauing or even decreasing as predictive errors grow. These results highlight fundamental limitations of current uncertainty quantification approaches and underscore the need for caution when using predictive precision as a stand-in for accuracy in large-scale, extrapolative applications.",

    "summary": "The development of resilient and lightweight Aluminum alloys is central to advancing structural materials for energy-efficient engineering applications. To address this challenge, in this study, we explore the elastic properties of Al-Mg-Zr solid solutions by integrating advanced machine learning (ML) techniques with quantum-mechanical (QM) atomistic simulations. For this purpose, we develop accurate and transferable machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) using two complementary approaches: (i) an on-the-fly learning scheme combined with Bayesian linear regression during ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and (ii) the equivariant neural network architecture MACE. Both MLIPs facilitate the prediction of composition-dependent elastic properties while drastically reducing the computational cost compared to conventional QM methods. Comparison with ultrasonic measurements shows that the deviation between simulation and experiment remains within a few GPa across all Al-Mg-Zr systems investigated. These potentials also enable the systematic exploration of the Al-Mg-Zr solid solution phase space and provide insights into the elastic behavior as a function of alloying element concentration. Hence, our findings demonstrate the reliability and transferability of the parameterized on-the-fly MLIPs, making them valuable for accelerating the design of Al alloys with tailored physicomechanical properties in complex compositional spaces. While the present study focuses on homogeneous phases, it establishes a foundation for future multiscale simulations that include microstructural features such as precipitates and grain boundaries.",

    "summary": "With the advent of quantum simulators of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories (LGTs), a fundamental open question is under what circumstances the observed physics is genuinely $2+1$D rather than effectively $1+1$D. Here, we address this question in the ongoing strong effort to quantum-simulate string dynamics in $2+1$D LGTs on state-of-the-art quantum hardware. Through tensor network simulations and analytic derivations, we show that the plaquette term, which represents a magnetic field and only emerges in $d>1$ spatial dimensions, plays a crucial role in \\textit{genuine} $2+1$D string dynamics deep in the confined regime. In its absence and for minimal-length (Manhattan-distance) strings, we demonstrate how string breaking, although on a lattice in $d=2$ spatial dimensions, can be effectively mapped to a $1+1$D dynamical process independently of lattice geometry. Our findings not only answer the question of what qualifies as genuine $2+1$D string dynamics, but also serve as a clear guide for future quantum simulation experiments of $2+1$D LGTs.",

    "summary": "Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates exhibit high-temperature superconductivity closely intertwined with charge and spin density wave order. However, fundamental questions persist regarding the interplay between the associated density wave (DW) fluctuations and superconductivity, as well as the orbital character and symmetry underlying the DW instabilities. Here we utilize polarized Raman scattering to investigate the phononic and electronic Raman responses of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ across its concomitant charge and spin density wave transitions. In addition to distinct phonon anomalies occurring below the transition temperature, we observe a depletion of continuum spectral weight up to 114 meV and a pronounced peak centered at this energy. By combining momentum-selective information from polarized electronic Raman scattering with model calculations involving both Ni-3$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, we identify 114 meV as the energy scale $2\\Delta_\\mathrm{DW}$ of the DW gap, characterized by incoherent opening and non-mean-field behavior. Furthermore, the model calculations reveal that the corresponding $2\\Delta_\\mathrm{DW}$ peak exhibits a multiorbital origin, thus shedding light on the nature of the DW instabilities in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$.",

Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.",

    "summary": "The Lieb lattice, originally proposed for cuprate superconductors, has gained new attention in the emerging field of altermagnetism as a minimal analytical model for the latter. While initially the so-called inverse Lieb lattice (ILL) was deemed only a theoretical model, recently several real materials with this crystallographic motif have been found. The unique geometry of ILL can accommodate complex magnetic orderings arising from competing exchange interactions and geometric frustration, offering great tunability for magnetic properties. In this work, we provide comprehensive insights into magnetic phases in ILL materials and establish guidelines for efficient identification of altermagnetic materials within this family. We begin by constructing phase diagrams using a simple Heisenberg model to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying altermagnetism and other complex magnetic phases observed experimentally. To bridge theory with experiment, we systematically investigate a series of existing ILL compounds using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine their magnetic ground states. Our computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, we identify a trend linking magnetic ordering to the $d$-shell filling of transition metal ions, with $d^{2-3}$ and $d^{5}$ configurations showing propensity for altermagnetic behavior. Additionally, we identify a promising metallic compound Sr$_{2}$CrO$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$OAs$_{2}$ as an altermagnet that is highly anisotropic in its $J_2$ exchange couplings with large N\\'eel temperature ($\\sim 600$ K). Using exchange coupling parameters extracted from DFT calculations, we compute the magnon spectra for altermagnetic systems. As expected, chiral splittings in the magnon dispersion are directly correlated with anisotropy between crystallographically inequivalent $J_{2}$ exchange interactions.",

    "summary": "We explore machine learning techniques for predicting Curie temperatures of magnetic materials using the NEMAD database. By augmenting the dataset with composition-based and domain-aware descriptors, we evaluate the performance of several machine learning models. We find that the Extra Trees Regressor delivers the best performance reaching an R^2 score of up to 0.85 $\\pm$ 0.01 (cross-validated) for a balanced dataset. We employ the k-means clustering algorithm to gain insights into the performance of chemically distinct material groups. Furthermore, we perform the SHAP analysis to identify key physicochemical drivers of Curie behavior, such as average atomic number and magnetic moment. By employing explainable AI techniques, this analysis offers insights into the model's predictive behavior, thereby advancing scientific interpretability.",

    "summary": "The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.",

    "summary": "Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.",

    "summary": "We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.",

Generally, estimating such information-entropy-based quantities requires having complete statistics of the system's states. Here we explore the possibility to reconstruct the classical mutual information and specific entropy of a quantum system with neural network approach on the basis of limited number of projective measurements. As a prominent example we consider the antiferromagnetic quantum Ising model in transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields which is in demand in both condensed matter physics and quantum computing. We show that the neural network approach gives reliable estimates of the classical mutual information even in the case of paramagnetic wave functions delocalized in the state space. In addition, the phase diagram of the considered quantum system is reconstructed with a special focus on discriminating various types of disordered states.",

    "summary": "The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial, unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source, multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments. By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.",

We give a sufficient condition that they coincide with each other, in terms of both a condition number, which quantifies the normality of a Liouvillian, and some spectral gaps on finite subsystems. To appreciate the importance of the condition number, we provide an example in which the spectral gaps have nonzero lower bounds uniformly for any finite subsystems but a thermodynamic limit and a long-time limit (or a long-time average) do not commute with each other.",

However, actually the real insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet (S=1) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless (S=0) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. Taking account of only charge degree of freedom we develop a novel minimal $U$-$V$-$t_b$-model for nickelates making use of the charge triplet model with the pseudospin formalism and effective field approximation. We show the existence of two types of CD-phases, high-temperature classical CO-phase with the G-type charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and low-temperature quantum CDq-phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, uncertain valence and spin value for NiO$_6$ centers. Model $T$-R phase diagram reproduces main features of the phase diagram found for RNiO$_3$.",

    "summary": "Due to their aspect ratio and wide range of thermal conductivities, nanotubes hold significant promise as heat-management nanocomponents. Their practical use is, however, often limited by thermal resistance introduced by structural defects or material interfaces. An intriguing question is the role that structural symmetry plays in thermal transport through those defect-laden sections. To address this, we develop a framework that combines representation theory with the mode-resolved Green's function method, enabling a detailed, symmetry-resolved analysis of phonon transmission through defected segments of quasi-1D systems. To avoid artifacts inherent to formalisms developed for bulk 3D systems, we base our analysis on line groups, the appropriate description of the symmetries of quasi-1D structures. This categorization introduces additional quantum numbers that partition the phonon branches into smaller, symmetry-distinct subsets, enabling clearer mode classification. We employ an Allegro-based machine learning potential to obtain the force constants and phonons with near-ab-initio accuracy. We calculate detailed phonon transmission profiles for single- and multi-layer MoS$_\\mathrm{2}$-WS$_\\mathrm{2}$ nanotubes and connect the transmission probability of each mode to structural symmetry. Surprisingly, we find that pronounced symmetry breaking can suppress scattering by relaxing selection rules and opening additional transmission channels. That higher disorder introduced through defects can enhance thermal transport, and not just suppress it, demonstrates the critical role of symmetry in deciphering the nuances of nanoscale thermal transport.",

    "summary": "The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials science.",

Essential to describing optical transitions is electron-phonon coupling, which can be predicted from first principles but requires computationally expensive evaluation of all phonon modes in simulation cells containing hundreds of atoms. We demonstrate that this bottleneck can be overcome using machine learning interatomic potentials with negligible accuracy loss. A key finding is that atomic relaxation data from routine first-principles calculations suffice as a dataset for fine-tuning, though additional data can further improve models. The efficiency of this approach enables studies of defect vibrational properties with high-level theory. We fine-tune to hybrid functional calculations to obtain highly accurate spectra, comparing with explicit calculations and experiments for various defects. Notably, we resolve fine details of local vibrational mode coupling in the luminescence spectrum of the T center in Si, a prominent quantum defect.",

However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\\beta} \\, \\mathrm{poly}\\, D)$ where $\\beta \\le 1 + \\log_2 \\sqrt{D}/ s_{\\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\\min}$ is the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.",

For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we find a ''chiral flux'' phase which is characterized by the generation of a finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)$_m$ magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which, due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions. Further, sufficiently strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.",

    "summary": "Borides are a rich material family. To push the boundaries of borides' properties and applications into broader fields, we have conducted systematic theoretical and experimental searches for synthesizable phases in ternary borides TM$_2$B$_2$ (T = 3d, M = 4d/5d transition metals). We find that TM$_2$B$_2$ in the FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type and CoW$_2$B$_2$-type structures form a large family of stable/metastable materials of 120 members. Among them, we identify 40 materials with stable magnetic solutions. Further, we discover 11 altermagnets in the FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type structure. So far, boride altermagnets are rare. In these altermagnets, T = Fe or Mn atoms are arranged in parallel T-chains with strong ferromagnetic intrachain couplings and antiferromagnetic interchain couplings. They simultaneously exhibit electronic band spin splitting, typical of ferromagnetism, and zero net magnetization, typical of antiferromagnetism. They also exhibit magnonic band chiral splitting. Both effects originate from the unique altermagnetic symmetries crucially constrained by the nonmagnetic atoms in the structure. Transport properties of relevance to spintronic applications, including the strain-induced spin-splitter effect and anomalous Hall effect, are predicted. An iodine-assisted synthesis method for TM$_2$B$_2$ is developed, using which 7 of the predicted low-energy phases are experimentally synthesized and characterized, including 4 altermagnets. This work expands the realm of borides by offering new opportunities for studying altermagnetism and altermagnons in borides. It also provides valuable insights into the discovery and design of altermagnets. By demonstrating that altermagnets can exist as families sharing a common motif, this work paves a feasible route for discovering altermagnets by elemental substitutions and high-throughput computations.",

    "summary": "In recent years, efficient quantum circuit simulations incorporating ideal noise assumptions have relied on tensor network simulators, particularly leveraging the matrix product density operator (MPDO) framework. However, experiments on real noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices often involve complex noise profiles, encompassing uncontrollable elements and instrument-specific effects such as crosstalk. To address these challenges, we employ quantum process tomography (QPT) techniques to directly capture the operational characteristics of the experimental setup and integrate them into numerical simulations using MPDOs. Our QPT-assisted MPDO simulator is then applied to explore a variational approach for generating noisy entangled states, comparing the results with standard noise numerical simulations and demonstrations conducted on the Quafu cloud quantum computation platform. Additionally, we investigate noisy MaxCut problems, as well as the effects of crosstalk and noise truncation. Our results provide valuable insights into the impact of noise on NISQ devices and lay the foundation for enhanced design and assessment of quantum algorithms in complex noise environments.",

These circuits consist of random gates arranged in a brick-wall architecture. While the multiqubit state in the middle of the circuit can exhibit significant entanglement, the final state is, with high probability, a predetermined pure bitstring. A technique is introduced to obscure the final bitstring in the structure of the quantum circuit. The algorithm allows precise control over the probability of the final peaked state. A modified version of the algorithm enables the construction of double- or multi-peaked quantum circuits. The matrix product state (MPS) method is evaluated for simulating such circuits; it performs effectively for shallow peaked circuits but offers no significant advantage for deeper ones.",

By utilizing an advanced tensor network method to compress the quantum circuit, we overcome the intrinsic limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. This enables high-fidelity simulations of time evolution over extended timescales and various interesting dynamical behaviours are observed in our digital quantum simulation. We start from the quantum simulation of the single-particle quantum walk on the FB and AFB lattices, which are realized by tuning the magnetic flux per plaquette to $\\phi=0$ and $\\phi=\\pi$ respectively. With compressed quantum circuit, we are able to simulate the delocalization in FB lattice and the Aharonov-Bohm caging in AFB lattice. Next, we integrate FB and ABF lattices within a one-dimensional lattice structure and study how these lattices can be utilized to control quantum transport. Moreover, we investigate the effectiveness of a single ABF lattice in controlling the two particles dynamics without and with interaction. We find that the hopping amplitude remains an effective and tunable parameter for controlling particle transport even in the presence of interactions. Our results show that digital quantum simulations of flat-band physics are feasible on current digital NISQ devices through circuit compression. Moreover, this capability enables us to study the potential applications of flat-band systems in quantum control and emerging quantum technologies.",

We use an analytic approach to show that the fully spin-polarized state becomes unstable to a metastable spin-polaron when the kinetic frustration $t'/t$ exceeds a critical, dimension-dependent value. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal a quantum phase transition from the NT ferromagnet to a spiral spin-density wave, which evolves continuously into the Haerter-Shastry antiferromagnet in the large-frustration limit. Remarkably, this transition remains robust at low but finite hole density, making it accessible in cold-atom and moir\\'e Hubbard platforms under strong interactions. A variational analysis further captures the instability mechanism at finite density via frustration-induced magnon band deformation.",

    "summary": "Cuprate superconductors show various collective charge correlations that are intimately connected with their electronic properties. In particular, charge order in the form of an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) order with an in-plane wavevector $\\delta_{\\text{CDW}} \\approx $ 0.23--0.35~r.l.u. appears to be universally present. In addition to CDW, dynamic charge density fluctuations (CDF) are also present with wavevectors comparable to $\\delta_{\\text{CDW}}$. CDFs are present up to $\\sim300\\;$K and have relatively short correlation lengths of $\\xi \\sim 20$\\;\\AA. Here we use Cu-$L_3$ and O-$K$ resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to study the doping dependence of CDW and CDFs in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. We fit our data with (quasi)elastic peaks resulting from the CDW and up to four inelastic modes associated with oxygen phonons that can be strongly coupled to the CDFs. Our analysis allows us to separate the charge correlations into three components: the CDW with wavevector $\\delta_{4a-\\text{CDW}} \\approx 0.24$ and two CDF components with $\\delta_{4a-\\text{CDF}} \\approx 0.24$ and $\\delta_{3a-\\text{CDF}} \\approx 0.30$. We find that for $T \\approx T_c$ the CDW coexists with the CDFs for dopings near $x=p \\sim 1/8$. The $4a$-CDW disappears beyond $x=0.16$ and the $4a$-CDF beyond $x=0.19$, leaving only a weak $3a$-CDF at the highest doping studied, $x=0.22$. Our data suggest that low-energy charge fluctuations exist up to doping $x=0.19=p^{\\star}$, where the pseudogap disappears, however, we find no evidence that they are associated with a quantum critical point.",

    "summary": "The research landscape of magnetism has been recently enriched by the discovery of altermagnetism. It is an unconventional phase of matter characterized by a d-wave (or higher even-parity-wave) collinear compensated spin ordering, which enables strongly spin-polarized currents in the absence of magnetization, and features fast spin dynamics. Simultaneously, on the applied magnetism front, spintronic memories based on conventional ferromagnets are currently turning from a niche to a mass produced integrated-circuit technology as they start to complement semiconductors on advanced-node microprocessor chips. Our review connects these two rapidly developing science and technology fields by discussing how the unique signatures of altermagnetism can impact the functionality and scalability of future spintronic devices. As a reference, we first briefly recall the merits and physical limitations of the present ferromagnetic spintronic technology, and of proof-of-concept spintronic devices based on conventional collinear antiferromagnets and non-collinear compensated magnets. The main part of the review then focuses on physical concepts of the altermagnetic spintronics, and its potential interplay with ferroelectricity or superconductivity. We conclude with an outlook on the nascent experimental research of altermagnetic spintronics, and on the role of relativistic phenomena.",

    "summary": "We study sign structures of the ground states of spin-$1/2$ magnetic systems using the methods of Boolean Fourier analysis. Previously it was shown that the sign structures of frustrated systems are of complex nature: specifically, neural networks of popular architectures lack the generalization ability necessary to effectively reconstruct sign structures in supervised learning settings. This is believed to be an obstacle for applications of neural quantum states to frustrated systems. In the present work, we develop an alternative language for the analysis of sign structures based on representing them as polynomial functions defined on the Boolean hypercube - an approach called Boolean Fourier analysis. We discuss the relations between the properties of the Boolean Fourier series and the learning complexity of sign structures, and demonstrate that such polynomials can potentially serve as variational ans\\\"atze for the complex sign structures that dramatically outperform neural networks in terms of generalization ability. While ans\\\"atze of this type cannot yet be directly used in the context of variational optimization, they indicate that the complexity of sign structures is not an insurmountable curse, and can potentially be learned with better designed NQS architectures. Finally, we show how augmenting data with Boolean functions can aid sign prediction by neural networks.",

    "summary": "Utilizing ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we investigated the quasiparticle and spin dynamics in single crystals of bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the presence of two distinct density wave (DW)-like orders, manifesting with onset temperatures at $\\sim$140 K and $\\sim$115 K. Through time-resolved ellipticity measurements, we identified the higher-temperature order at 140 K ($T_{\\rm SDW}$) as the onset of a spin density wave (SDW) with associated electronic nematicity. In contrast, the lower-temperature order is attributed to a charge order. A key finding is the differential response of these orders to photoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of approximately 40 $\\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200 $\\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to approximately 70 K. These compelling experimental observations provide critical insights into the coexistence and manipulability of density wave phenomena in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, laying a foundation for future research into their optical control.",

Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.",

We present the Symmetry-Constrained Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural Network (SCMS-PINN) v35, which directly learns graphene band structures while rigorously enforcing crystallographic symmetries through a multi-head architecture. Our approach introduces three specialized ResNet-6 pathways -- K-head for Dirac physics, M-head for saddle points, and General head for smooth interpolation -- operating on 31 physics-informed features extracted from k-points. Progressive Dirac constraint scheduling systematically increases the weight parameter from 5.0 to 25.0, enabling hierarchical learning from global topology to local critical physics. Training on 10,000 k-points over 300 epochs achieves 99.99\\% reduction in training loss (34.597 to 0.003) with validation loss of 0.0085. The model predicts Dirac point gaps within 30.3 $\\mu$eV of theoretical zero and achieves average errors of 53.9 meV (valence) and 40.5 meV (conduction) across the Brillouin zone. All twelve C$_{6v}$ operations are enforced through systematic averaging, guaranteeing exact symmetry preservation. This framework establishes a foundation for extending physics-informed learning to broader two-dimensional materials for accelerated discovery.",

However, accurately computing and minimizing the energy expectation value remains challenging, in part because the impact of the gauge degrees of freedom that are present in the tensor network representation is poorly understood. We analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this effect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need for gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational PEPS in general settings.",

We calculate the ferroelectric soft mode frequency as a function of volume, lattice parameters and temperature for ST$^{16}$O and ST$^{18}$O, and find that the phase space in which ST$^{16}$O shows quantum paraelectric behaviour, while ST$^{18}$O becomes ferroelectric is narrow.

    "summary": "Polymorphism, the ability of a compound to crystallize in multiple distinct structures, plays a vital role in determining the physical, chemical, and functional properties of materials. Accurate identification and prediction of polymorphic structures are critical for materials design, drug development, and device optimization, as unknown or overlooked polymorphs may lead to unexpected performance or stability issues. Despite its significance, predicting polymorphism directly from a chemical composition remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between molecular conformations, crystal packing, and symmetry constraints. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive data-driven analysis of polymorphic materials from the Materials Project database, uncovering key statistical patterns in their composition, space group distributions, and polyhedral building blocks. We discover that frequent polymorph pairs across space groups, such as (71, 225), display recurring topological motifs that persist across different compounds, highlighting topology not symmetry alone as a key factor in polymorphic recurrence. We reveal that many polymorphs exhibit consistent local polyhedral environments despite differences in their symmetry or packing. Additionally, by constructing polyhedron connectivity graphs and embedding their topology, we successfully cluster polymorphs and structurally similar materials even across different space groups, demonstrating that topological similarity serves as a powerful descriptor for polymorphic behavior. Our findings provide new insights into the structural characteristics of polymorphic materials and demonstrate the potential of data mining and machine learning for accelerating polymorph discovery and design.",

In DMFT, the lattice of the model is replaced by a single impurity site embedded in an effective bath. The resulting single impurity Anderson model (SIAM) can then be solved self-consistently with a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm. This procedure involves repeatedly preparing the ground state on a quantum computer and evolving it in time to measure the Greens function. We here develop an approximation of the time evolution operator for this setting by training a Hamiltonian variational ansatz. The parameters of the ansatz are obtained via a variational quantum algorithm that utilizes a small number of time steps, given by the Suzuki- Trotter expansion of the time evolution operator, to guide the evolution of the parameters. The resulting circuit has constant depth for the time evolution and is significantly shallower than a comparable Suzuki-Trotter expansion.",

    "summary": "As the core determinant of lithium-ion battery performance, electrode materials play a crucial role in defining the battery's capacity, cycling stability, and durability. During charging and discharging, electrode materials undergo complex ion intercalation and deintercalation processes, accompanied by defect formation and structural evolution. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying processes such as cation disordering, lattice oxygen loss, and stage structure formation phenomena are still not fully understood. To address these challenges, we have developed the Electrode Dynamic Ion Intercalation/Deintercalation Simulator (EDIS), a software platform designed to simulate the dynamic processes of ion intercalation and deintercalation in electrode materials. Leveraging high-precision machine learning potentials, EDIS can efficiently model structural evolution and lithium-ion diffusion behavior under various states of charge and discharge, achieving accuracy approaching that of quantum mechanical methods in relevant chemical spaces. The software supports quantitative analysis of how variations in lithium-ion concentration and distribution affect lithium-ion transport properties, enables evaluation of the impact of structural defects, and allows for tracking of both structural evolution and transport characteristics during continuous cycling. EDIS is versatile and can be extended to sodium-ion batteries and related systems. By enabling in-depth analysis of these microscopic processes, EDIS provides a robust theoretical tool for mechanistic studies and the rational design of high-performance electrode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries.",

    "summary": "Ground State Energy Estimation (GSEE) is a central problem in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, demanding efficient algorithms to solve complex electronic structure calculations. This work introduces a structured benchmarking framework for evaluating the performance of both classical and quantum solvers on diverse GSEE problem instances. We assess three prominent methods -- Semistochastic Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI), Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), and Double-Factorized Quantum Phase Estimation (DF QPE) -- ighlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Our results show that fully optimized SHCI achieves near-universal solvability on the benchmark set, DMRG excels for low-entanglement systems, and DF QPE is currently constrained by hardware and algorithmic limitations. However, we observe that many benchmark Hamiltonians are drawn from datasets tailored to SHCI and related approaches, introducing a bias that favors classical solvers. To mitigate this, we propose expanding the benchmark suite to include more challenging, strongly correlated systems to enable a more balanced and forward-looking evaluation of solver capabilities. As quantum hardware and algorithms improve, this benchmarking framework will serve as a vital tool for tracking progress and identifying domains where quantum methods may surpass classical techniques. The QB-GSEE benchmark repository is openly available at https://github.com/isi-usc-edu/qb-gsee-benchmark [1]. By maintaining a scalable and open resource, we aim to accelerate innovation in computational quantum chemistry and quantum computing.",

For appropriately spaced emitters, they realize the Dicke model, whose characteristic permutation symmetry allows for efficient exact solutions featuring superradiance. When the emitters are arbitrarily spaced, however, this symmetry is lost and general analytical solutions are no longer available. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical method to study the dynamics of such systems by extending the time-dependent neural quantum state (t-NQS) framework to open quantum systems. We benchmark our approach across a range of waveguide QED settings and compare its performance with tensor-network calculations. Our results demonstrate that the t-NQS approach is competitive with other numerical methods and highlight the potential of t-NQSs for studying open quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium.",

    "summary": "The creation of large-scale, high-fidelity quantum computers is not only a fundamental scientific endeavour in itself, but also provides increasingly robust proofs of quantum computational advantage (QCA) in the presence of unavoidable noise and the dynamic competition with classical algorithm improvements. To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA experiments, photon loss, we report new Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) experiments with 1024 high-efficiency squeezed states injected into a hybrid spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor, Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon detection events. Our experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of GBS. Using the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI Capitan, it would take > $10^{42}$ years to construct the required tensor network for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 $\\mu$s to produce a sample. This work establishes a new frontier of QCA and paves the way to fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing hardware.",

A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.",

    "summary": "Random permutation circuits were recently introduced as minimal models for local many-body dynamics that can be interpreted both as classical and quantum. Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both quantum and classical.",

The reconstruction is orbital-selective, occurring predominantly in the $s$-orbital channel.

We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can be unbounded or fails to scale with system size.",

    "summary": "Classical simulations of quantum circuits are vital for assessing potential quantum advantage and benchmarking devices, yet they require sophisticated methods to avoid the exponential growth of resources. Tensor network approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum computing, condensed matter, and beyond.",

    "summary": "Cadmium telluride (CdTe), lead sulfide (PbS), and indium tin oxide (ITO) are important in various electronic technologies, for which laser irradiation is used to selectively modify and design their unique semiconductor properties. We employ the hybrid multiscale code XTANT-3 to simulate the kinetics of material response to ultrafast X-ray irradiation. The code accounts for nonequilibrium electronic and atomic dynamics, nonadiabatic coupling, nonthermal melting, and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. Among the materials studied, CdTe exhibits the highest radiation resistance, similar to CdS. At the respective threshold doses, the melting is primarily thermal, driven by electron-phonon coupling, which is accompanied by the band gap closure. Additionally, all materials show nonthermal melting at higher doses. Threshold doses increase further if energy sinks and recrystallization are included. In CdTe and PbS, below 1.5 eV/atom, the band gap returns to its original value upon recrystallization. As the dose increases, the cooled state becomes more amorphous, reducing the band gap until it stabilizes. Curiously, in a narrow window of deposited doses, ITO exhibit transient superionic behavior, with the liquid oxygen but solid In and Sn sublattices. At 0.6 eV/atom in CdTe and 0.4 eV/atom in PbS and ITO, material ablation from the surface occurs. The results suggest that femtosecond lasers may be used for tuning the band gap of photovoltaic semiconductors.",

Here, we carry out a similar construction using two copies of non-interacting Euler insulators to produce a class of spinful interacting Euler models. To that end, we take advantage of the recently discovered exact representation of certain Euler insulators by a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) of bond dimension $D = 2$. The Gutzwiller projection can be implemented within the tensor network formalism, giving rise to a new PEPS of bond dimension $D = 4$. We, moreover, apply very recent state-of-the-art tensor network tools to evaluate these phases. In particular, we analyze its entanglement entropy scaling and find no topological correction to the area law, indicating that the state is not intrinsically topologically ordered. Its entanglement spectrum shows a clear cusp at momentum zero, similar to non-interacting Euler insulators, and the spectrum of the transfer operator indicates that the state is gapped, which could imply non-intrinsic topological features. Finally, the static structure factor displays Bragg peaks, indicating the simultaneous presence of local order.",

Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.",

First, 1312 synthetic three-dimensional microstructures were generated and evaluated using established algorithms, and a labeled data set of ground-truth parameters was built. Converting every structure into a persistence image allowed us to train a deep neural network that predicts the eight descriptors. In an independent test set, the model achieved on average R^2 ~ 0.84 and Pearson r ~ 0.92, demonstrating both precision and generality. The approach provides a unified and scalable tool for rapid characterization of functional porous materials.",

    "summary": "Accurate quantum simulations of catalysis on metal surfaces are critical for advancing energy and materials science. Yet most existing methods fall short: density functional theory (DFT), although widely used for its computational efficiency, often lacks the accuracy needed for adsorption and reaction energetics at heterogeneous metal surfaces. Wavefunction-based theories, in contrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when applied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a quantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of accurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while retaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such as auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at catalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable framework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy for two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference site of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface, where conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving quantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals why DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the critical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION thus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of complex catalytic systems.",

A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.",

    "summary": "An excitonic insulator is a material that hosts an exotic ground state, where an energy gap opens due to spontaneous condensation of bound electron-hole pairs. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role.",

    "summary": "While traditional trial-and-error methods for designing amorphous alloys are costly and inefficient, machine learning approaches based solely on composition lack critical atomic structural information. Machine learning interatomic potentials, trained on data from first-principles calculations, offer a powerful alternative by efficiently approximating the complex three-dimensional potential energy surface with near-DFT accuracy. In this work, we develop a general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for amorphous alloys by using a dataset comprising 20400 configurations across representative binary and ternary amorphous alloys systems. The model demonstrates excellent predictive performance on an independent test set, with a mean absolute error of 5.06 meV/atom for energy and 128.51 meV/\\r{A} for forces. Through extensive validation, the model is shown to reliably capture the trends in macroscopic property variations such as density, Young's modulus and glass transition temperature across both the original training systems and the compositionally modified systems derived from them. It can be directly applied to composition-property mapping of amorphous alloys. Furthermore, the developed interatomic potential enables access to the atomic structures of amorphous alloys, allowing for microscopic analysis and interpretation of experimental results, particularly those deviating from empirical trends.This work breaks the long-standing computational bottleneck in amorphous alloys research by developing the first general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for amorphous alloy systems. The resulting framework provides a robust foundation for data-driven design and high-throughput composition screening in a field previously constrained by traditional simulation limitations.",

Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with constrained density functional perturbation theory, we demonstrate that photoexcited carrier density can serve as a tuning knob to enhance electron-phonon interactions in nonequilibrium conditions. Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2H-MoTe$_2$ reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase. Through theoretical analysis of photoinduced electron and phonon energy and linewidth renormalizations, we attribute these transient features to nonequilibrium modifications of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. The present study advances our understanding of microscopic coupling mechanisms enabling control over relaxation pathways in driven solids.",

Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 > 0$ and $J_2 > 0$, showing an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW) phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels, strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional kagome system.",

Here we use analytical arguments and numerical evidence to illuminate how spontaneous symmetry breaking of a non-invertible symmetry is similar yet distinct from ordinary, invertible, symmetry breaking. We consider one-dimensional chains of group-valued qudits, whose local Hilbert space is spanned by elements of a finite group $G$ (reducing to ordinary qubits when $G=\\mathbb{Z}_2$). We construct Ising-type transverse-field Hamiltonians with Rep($G$) symmetry whose generators multiply according to the tensor product of irreducible representations (irreps) of the group $G$. For non-Abelian $G$, the symmetry is non-invertible. In the symmetry broken phase there is one ground state per irrep on a closed chain. The symmetry breaking can be detected by local order parameters but, unlike the invertible case, different ground states have distinct entanglement patterns. We show that for each irrep of dimension greater than one the corresponding ground state exhibits string order, entanglement spectrum degeneracies, and has gapless edge modes on an open chain -- features usually associated with symmetry-protected topological order. Consequently, domain wall excitations behave as one-dimensional non-Abelian anyons with non-trivial internal Hilbert spaces and fusion rules. Our work identifies properties of non-invertible symmetry breaking that existing quantum hardware can probe.",

    "summary": "Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a stochastic approach for solving the many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation without resorting to one-body approximations. QMC algorithms are readily parallelizable via ensembles of $N_w$ walkers, making them well suited to large-scale high-performance computing. Among the QMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most reliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given Hamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of DMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which discretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework. DMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to stabilize walker weights and populations. At the branching step, walkers must be synchronized globally; any imbalance in per-walker workload can leave CPU or GPU cores idle, thereby degrading overall hardware utilization. The conventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance, which grows as $\\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel architectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently addresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved weak-scaling parallel efficiency. Using the binding energy calculation of a water-methane complex as a test case, we demonstrated that the conventional and load-balanced LRDMC algorithms yield consistent results. Furthermore, by utilizing the Leonardo supercomputer equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we demonstrated that the load-balanced LRDMC algorithm can maintain extremely high parallel efficiency ($\\sim$98\\%) up to 512 GPUs (corresponding to $N_{\\rm w}= 51200$), together with a speedup of $\\times~1.24$ if directly compared with the conventional LRDMC algorithm with the same number of walkers.",

Here, we present an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) study of Co1/4TaSe2, a compound we identify as a layered altermagnetic material. Magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm type A antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature of 178 K. Our ARPES measurements reveal an electronic band structure in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, demonstrating clear signatures of altermagnetic spin splitting at the Fermi surface. Furthermore, temperature dependent ARPES reveals a reconstructed valence band structure, with observable band shifts and the closing of energy gaps upon heating above the Neel temperature (TN), consistent with the suppression of altermagnetic order. These findings establish Co1/4TaSe2 as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetic phenomena.",

    "summary": "We investigate the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) in infinite-layer nickelate films with different disorder levels. The disordered NdNiO$_{2}$ film exhibits a flat $S/T$ curve, whereas cleaner samples display a logarithmic divergence with decreasing temperature, followed by a pronounced ``hump'' near 25 K. These distinct behaviors reveal a disorder-driven transition from band-structure-dominated transport to quantum-critical-dominated transport. Below the ``hump'' temperature, four-fold symmetry breaking is observed in the in-plane angular magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of short-range antiferromagnetic order in parent infinite-layer nickelate films. Furthermore, the logarithmic divergence in $S/T$ is also observed in a clean superconducting Sm$_{0.73}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.22}$NiO$_{2}$ film, where it coexists with linear-in-temperature resistivity over the same temperature range. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum criticality over a wide doping range in clean infinite-layer nickelate films, similar to cuprates, which highlights the central role of antiferromagnetic spin correlations in their superconducting pairing mechanisms.",

Unlike the spin polarization at the Fermi level, which follows the pseudospin, the proximity-induced magnetic moments vary across carbon atoms, defying analytical modeling. To address this, we develop a Random Forest model trained on DFT data and employ Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions descriptors to map the local ($\\sim 2\\,$nm$^2$) atomic-scale geometry to the carbon magnetic moments. Besides demonstrating locality, the model reveals rich magnetic moir\\'e textures. Crucially, this method can be broadly applied to orbital and spin proximity effects that are highly sensitive to local atomic environments and are beyond analytical description.",

    "summary": "Interfacial ferroelectricity offers a promising platform for ultrafast, low-power memory devices. While previous studies have attributed polarization switching to full-layer sliding, the symmetry constraints pose fundamental limitations. By integrating first-principles calculations, machine learning methods, and experimental validations, we show that domain walls within in-plane polarization break C3 symmetry, enabling polarization switching under out-of-plane electric fields. Local polarization vectors deviate to response to the field, leading to local reconstruction, and ultimately drives the migration of domain walls. This mechanism bears clear resemblance to that in traditional ferroelectrics. Notably, different domain wall types result in distinct switching behaviors, which play a crucial role in determining the reversibility of polarization switching. We then propose strategies beyond ideal conditions to achieve non-volatile ferroelectric switching, successfully realized by our experiments. These insights clarify the microscopic switching mechanism in hexagonal interfacial ferroelectrics, providing a basis for future nanoelectronics applications.",

We present a matrix product state (MPS) solver for the GP equation that efficiently compresses the wavefunction by truncating weak interlength-scale correlations. This approach reduces memory use by factors ranging from 10x to over 10,000x compared to DNS. We benchmark our approach on nonlinear excitations, namely dark solitons (1D) and quantized vortices (2D, 3D), capturing key dynamics like Kelvin wave propagation and vortex ring emission in the case of vortex line reconnection. For turbulent states composed of multiple nonlinear excitations, we find that the memory compression of the MPS representation is directly proportional to the soliton or vortex densities. We also accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation functions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the representative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave the way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited system sizes to uncover possible new physics.",

HEOs are a growing field with an enormous potential chemical composition space, and yet the discovery of new HEOs is slow and driven by experimental trial-and-error. In this work, we attempt to speed up this process by using a machine learned interatomic potential offering DFT-level accuracy. Our methodology starts by identifying a set of crystal structures and elements for screening, building a large random unit cell of each composition and structure, then relaxing this structure. The most promising candidates are distinguished based on the variance of the individual cation energies, which we introduce as our entropy descriptor, and the enthalpy of mixing, which is used as the enthalpy descriptor. The approach is applied to tetravalent HEOs, and its validity is confirmed by comparison to alternative descriptors and DFT calculations for a set of 7 elements. The search is then extended to a set of 14 elements and three crystal structures, where it successfully identifies the only known stable 4-component HEO in the $\\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, as well as predicting several new 5-component candidate systems. This approach can straightforwardly be applied to new sets of elements and structures, allowing for the accelerated discovery of new HEOs.",

    "summary": "Adapter-based fine-tuning has gained remarkable attention in adapting large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for a wide range of downstream tasks efficiently. In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned, without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices. Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.",

Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) reveal key mechanisms of cooperative vacancy transport, including incorporation of vacancies into clusters of arbitrary size. The simulations provide a coherent atomistic explanation for irradiation-induced vacancy patterns observed experimentally, especially the formation of line defects spanning tens of nanometers.

    "summary": "Transition metal complexes present significant challenges for electronic structure theory due to strong electron correlation arising from partially filled $d$-orbitals. We compare our recently developed Tensor Product Selected Configuration Interaction (TPSCI) with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) for computing exchange coupling constants in six transition metal systems, including dinuclear Cr, Fe, and Mn complexes and a tetranuclear Ni-cubane. TPSCI uses a locally correlated tensor product state basis to capture electronic structure efficiently while maintaining interpretability. From calculations on active spaces ranging from (22e,29o) to (42e,49o), we find that TPSCI consistently yields higher variational energies than DMRG due to truncation of local cluster states, but provides magnetic exchange coupling constants (J) generally within 10-30 cm$^{-1}$ of DMRG results. Key advantages include natural multistate capability enabling direct J extrapolation with smaller statistical errors, and computational efficiency for challenging systems. However, cluster state truncation represents a fundamental limitation requiring careful convergence testing, particularly for large local cluster dimensions. We identify specific failure cases where current truncation schemes break down, highlighting the need for improved cluster state selection methods and distributed memory implementations to realize TPSCI's full potential for strongly correlated systems.",

We account for the full wavenumber and frequency dependences of both the screened Coulomb interaction and phonon-mediated attraction. We present results for the prototypical uniform electron gas system with model Einstein phonons at temperatures of a few kelvin. At extremely low temperatures, we efficiently execute the required convolutions of Green's functions and interactions in Matsubara frequency and wavenumber using intermediate representation and Fourier convolution techniques. In particular, we elucidate the interplay between electron-phonon $\\omega$-mass and $k$-mass renormalizations of the electronic self-energy in determining the normal-state effective mass, spectral weight and the superconducting transition temperature. The electron density regimes where the plasmon effect enhances or suppresses the phonon-mediated superconductivity on top of the static Coulomb effect are revealed. We compare our comprehensive Eliashberg calculation results with those from density functional theory for superconductors, where the functionals have been constructed with reference to Eliashberg theory. Our model, methods, and results provide a valuable benchmark for first-principles superconducting calculations that treat screened Coulomb interaction effects non-empirically.",

    "summary": "Simulating liquid water to an accuracy that matches its wealth of available experimental data requires both precise electronic structure methods and reliable sampling of nuclear (quantum) motion. This is challenging because applying the electronic structure method of choice - coupled cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] - to condensed phase systems is currently limited by its computational cost and complexity. Recent tour-de-force efforts have demonstrated that this accuracy can indeed bring simulated liquid water into close agreement with experiment using machine learning potentials (MLPs). However, achieving this remains far from routine, requiring large datasets and significant computational cost. In this work, we introduce a practical approach that combines developments in MLPs with local correlation approximations to enable routine CCSD(T)-level simulations of liquid water. When combined with nuclear quantum effects, we achieve agreement to experiments for structural and transport properties. Crucially, this approach extends beyond constant volume to constant pressure simulations, allowing fundamental properties such as the density to now be predicted by MLP-based CCSD(T) models. Importantly, the approach also handles constant pressure simulations, enabling MLP-based CCSD(T) models to predict isothermal-isobaric bulk properties, such as water's density maximum in close agreement with experiment. Encompassing tests across electronic structure, datasets and MLP architecture, this work provides a practical blueprint towards routinely developing CCSD(T)-based MLPs for the condensed phase.",

Altermagnetic spin order in the ferrielectric phase of K3Cr2F7 transforms into a conventional antiferromagnetic order in the ferroelectric phase, at which strain/pressure engineered sizable changes of weak ferromagnetism can occur.

    "summary": "Altermagnetism presents intriguing possibilities for spintronic devices due to its unique combination of strong spin-splitting and zero net magnetization. However, realizing its full potential hinges on fabricating single-variant altermagnetic thin films. In this work, we present definitive evidence for the formation of single-variant altermagnetic RuO2(101) thin films with fully epitaxial growth on Al2O3(1-102) r-plane substrates, confirmed through rigorous structural analyses using X-ray diffraction, atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism. The mutual correspondence of the occupancy of oxygen atoms on the surfaces of RuO2(101)[010] and Al2O3(1-102)[11-20] plays a decisive role in the formation of the single-variant RuO2, which is also supported by our first-principles density functional theory calculations. We further observed spin-splitting magnetoresistance in the single-variant RuO2(101)/CoFeB bilayers, highlighting the characteristic effect of single variant on spin transport. The demonstration of single-variant RuO2(101) films marks a significant advancement in the field of altermagnetism and paves the way for exploring their potential applications.",

    "summary": "Lattice models are powerful tools for studying strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, but their general lack of exact solutions motivates efforts to simulate them in tunable platforms. Recently, a promising new candidate has emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moir\\'e systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG) subject to a moir\\'e potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D EG in a square moir\\'e potential can be systematically tuned into a system whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations in gate separation and moir\\'e potential depth affect the ground-state orders. A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding approach to triangular moir\\'e systems closer to current experimental conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.",

    "summary": "We revisit quantum false vacuum decay for the one-dimensional Ising model, focusing on the real-time nucleation and growth of true vacuum bubbles. Via matrix product state simulations, we demonstrate that for a wide range of parameters, the full time-dependent quantum state is well described by a Gaussian ansatz in terms of domain wall operators, with the associated vacuum bubble wave function evolving according to the linearized time-dependent variational principle. The emerging picture shows three different stages of evolution: an initial nucleation of small bubbles, followed by semi-classical bubble growth, which in turn is halted by the lattice phenomenon of Bloch oscillations. Furthermore, we find that the resonant bubble only plays a significant role in a certain region of parameter-space. However, when significant, it does lead to an approximately constant decay rate during the intermediate stage. Moreover, this rate is in quantitative agreement with the analytical result of Rutkevich (Phys. Rev. B 60, 14525) for which we provide an independent derivation based on the Gaussian ansatz.",

    "summary": "Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.",

Our previous work showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states. However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation ($\\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\\lambda$) rates. Using machine learning interatomic potentials and information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with these parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing. Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically complex alloys.",

Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role.",

We develop a many-body theory describing the nucleation and the coherent dynamics of true-vacuum bubbles that is analytically tractable and agrees with numerical matrix product state calculations in all parameter regimes up to intermediate times. This bosonic theory allows us to identify different regimes in the parameter space and unravel the underlying physical mechanisms. In particular, regimes that closely correspond to the cosmological false vacuum decay picture are highlighted and characterized in terms of observable quantities.",

    "summary": "Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target. The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms. Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be made with limited data.",

Here we explicitly execute the constrained search within a variational ansatz to construct a 1RDMF for the multi-orbital Hubbard model with up to seven orbitals in the thermodynamic limit. The variational ansatz is the \\mathcal{N}=3 ansatz of the variational discrete action theory (VDAT), which can be exactly evaluated in d=\\infty. The resulting 1RDMF exactly encapsulates the \\mathcal{N}=3 VDAT results, which accurately captures Mott and Hund physics. We find that non-analytic behavior emerges in our 1RDMF at fixed integer filling, which gives rise to the Mott transition. We explain this behavior by separating the constrained search into multiple stages, illustrating how a nonzero Hund exchange drives the continuous Mott transition to become first-order. Our approach creates a new path forward for constructing an accurate 1RDMF for strongly correlated electron materials.",

A central challenge in Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space associated with gauge degrees of freedom. In one spatial dimension, Gauss's law permits these gauge fields to be integrated out, yielding an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions among matter fields. We construct efficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our formulation naturally includes background fields and $\\theta$-terms, requiring no modifications to the standard iDMRG algorithm. This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D gauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as infinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a benchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing expected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical behavior at finite mass. Because the method alters only the MPO structure, it can be incorporated with little effort into a wide range of iMPS and infinite-boundary-condition algorithms, opening the way to efficient studies of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium gauge dynamics.",

In particular, the success of autoregressive models in natural language processing has motivated their use as variational ans\\\"atze, with the hope that their demonstrated ability to scale will transfer to simulations of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we introduce an autoregressive framework to calculate finite-temperature properties of a quantum system based on the imaginary-time evolution of an ensemble of pure states. We find that established approaches based on minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) have numerical instabilities when an autoregressive recurrent neural network is used as the variational ans\\\"atz. We show that these instabilities can be mitigated by evolving the initial ensemble states with a unitary operation, along with applying a threshold to curb runaway evolution of ensemble members. By comparing our algorithm to exact results for the spin 1/2 quantum XY chain, we demonstrate that autoregressive typical thermal states are capable of accurately calculating thermal observables.",

We present a scalable, GPU-accelerated uncertainty quantification framework based on $k$-nearest-neighbor kernel density estimation (KDE) in a PCA-reduced descriptor space. This method efficiently detects sparsely sampled regions in large, high-dimensional datasets and provides a transferable, model-agnostic uncertainty metric without requiring retraining costly model ensembles. The framework is validated across diverse case studies varying in: i) chemistry, ii) prediction models (including foundational neural network), iii) descriptors used for KDE estimation, and iv) properties whose uncertainty is sought. In all cases, the KDE-based score reliably flags extrapolative configurations, correlates well with conventional ensemble-based uncertainties, and highlights regions of reduced prediction trustworthiness. The approach offers a practical route for improving the interpretability, robustness, and deployment readiness of ML models in materials science.",

Understanding these defects under operating conditions is key since their electronic levels exhibit large thermal fluctuations that challenge the validity of static 0 K models. However, quantitative modelling of defect processes requires hybrid density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling, which is too expensive for direct molecular dynamic simulations. To address this, we train a multi-task machine learning force field to study $V_\\mathrm{Cl}$ in orthorhombic CsPbCl$_3$ at 300 K.While we observe strong oscillations in the optical transition level arising from the soft potential energy surface, neither the non-radiative capture barriers nor the thermodynamic charge transition levels are affected. Our results reveal that $V_\\mathrm{Cl}$ is not responsible for the non-radiative losses previously assumed. Instead, its impact on performance arises from other mechanisms, such as limiting the open-circuit voltage and promoting ionic migration. Our findings demonstrate that, despite strong dynamical effects in halide perovskites, the conventional static formalism of defect theory remains valid for predicting thermodynamic behavior, providing a sound basis for the design of high-performance energy materials.",

    "summary": "Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($>$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.",

    "summary": "Photoexcitation of single-layered La$_{0.5}$Mn$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ has played a key role in understanding orbital ordering and non-thermal states in the manganites. However, while orbital ordering in La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ breaks the in-plane C$_4$ symmetry, many layered manganites show much more complex phase diagrams in which orbital ordering emerges from an already symmetry-broken high-temperature phase and also exhibit additional low-temperature phases. In this work, we examine the role of these phases in relation to orbital ordering in the single-layered manganite Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ with a combination of optical reflection anisotropy and ultrafast broadband pump-probe spectroscopy. We find that the reflection anisotropy, measured in equilibrium, is strongly sensitive to charge and orbital-ordering transition only. However, the ultrafast response, measuring the non-equilibrium state is sensitive to all phases. In particular, we deduce that coherent phonons modulate unoccupied electronic states that are sensitive to the different phases of the material. This gives rise to a non-linear scaling of the phonon signal with pump fluence at specific probe wavelengths.",

This includes the Bethe-Salpeter equations and the Schwinger-Dyson equation from the parquet formalism, which we evaluate in two formally identical but numerically nonequivalent ways. We also study the first-order U(1) Ward identity between the vertex and the self-energy, which we derive for the first time in full generality in the real-frequency Keldysh formalism. We generally find good agreement of all relations, often up to a few percent, both at weak and at strong interaction.",

    "summary": "A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can exceed the bound of subsystem size, fail to scale with system size, or even take complex values.",

    "summary": "We have investigated the element specific magnetic characteristics of single-crystal FeCr2S4 using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). We have found that the Fe L2,3-edge XAS spectra do not exhibit clear multiplet structures, indicating strong hybridization between the Fe 3d and S 3p orbitals, leading to delocalized rather than localized electronic states. The Fe 3d and Cr 3d spin moments are antiferromagnetically coupled, consistent with the Goodenough-Kanamori rule. The orbital magnetic moments of Fe and Cr are determined to be -0.23 and -0.017 {\\mu}B/ion, respectively. The large orbital magnetic moment of Fe is due to the d6 configuration under the relatively weak tetrahedra crystal field at the Fe site, and the delocalized Fe electrons maintain the orbital degree of freedom in spite of their itinerant nature. To understand phenomena such as the gigantic Kerr rotation, it is essential to consider not only the orbital degrees of freedom but also the role of spin-orbit coupling, which induces a finite orbital magnetic moment through t2 and e level hybridization under the tetrahedral crystal field. This finite orbital moment serves as a direct indicator of spin-orbit interaction strength and links element-specific orbital magnetism to the large Kerr rotation. On the other hand, the octahedral crystal-field splitting of the Cr 3d level is large enough to result in the quenching of the orbital moment of the Cr ion in FeCr2S4.",

Their internal mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. We investigate the role of correlations for NQS-like quantum state representation by employing a correlation-based interpretable neural network architecture and thereafter proving our observations based on Boolean function theory. The correlator neural network demonstrates that, even for simple product states, up to all system-size correlation orders in the chosen computational basis are required to represent a quantum state faithfully. We explain these observations using the Fourier expansion, which reveals the correlator basis as the effective basis of the internal NQS structure, the resulting necessity for high-order correlations, potential linear dependencies in constrained Hilbert spaces, and connections between spin basis-rotations and the correlator basis. Furthermore, we analyze how activation functions, network architectures, and choice of reference basis influence correlation requirements. Our results provide new insights and a better understanding of the internal structure and requirements of NQS, enabling a more systematic use of NQS in future research.",

Although these simulations have provided valuable insight, the approximations used to determine possible reactions often lead to significant molecular strain and unrealistic structures. We show that the local molecular environment surrounding the reactive site plays a crucial role in determining the resulting molecular strain energy and, in turn, the associated reaction rates. We develop a graph neural network capable of predicting the strain energy associated with a cyclization reaction from the pre-reaction, local, molecular environment surrounding the reactive site. The model is trained on a large dataset of condensed-phase reactions during the activation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) obtained from MD simulations and can be used to adjust relative reaction rates in condensed systems and advance our understanding of thermally activated chemical processes in complex materials",

    "summary": "Accurate prediction of lattice thermal conductivity ($\\kappa_l$) in strongly anharmonic materials requires renormalized interatomic force constants (IFCs) and appropriate incorporation of diagonal and off-diagonal contributions and higher-order scattering. We investigate CuCl, a highly anharmonic system with a simple zincblende structure and ultralow $\\kappa_l$. Our calculations, including IFC renormalization and four-phonon scattering, show excellent agreement with the experiment, underscoring the critical role of both effects in the accurate estimation of $\\kappa_l$. Furthermore, the unusual pressure dependence of $\\kappa_l$ is explored using a rigorously validated machine-learned force field, with the predicted values showing good agreement with the experimentally observed trend of monotonic decrease. This behavior is primarily driven by a significant increase in four-phonon scattering and a reduction in the group velocity of transverse acoustic modes. Overall, this study establishes a robust framework for modeling thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials.",

    "summary": "We present a benchmark designed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of universal machine learning interatomic potentials across systems of varying dimensionality. Specifically, our benchmark tests zero- (molecules, atomic clusters, etc.), one- (nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, etc.), two- (atomic layers and slabs) and three-dimensional (bulk materials) compounds. The benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent performance for three-dimensional systems, accuracy degrades progressively for lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01-0.02 angstrom and errors in the energy below 10~meV/atom across all dimensionalities. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal machine learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and interfaces.",

However, this necessitates development of methods for physical interpretability of the resulting correlative models. Here, we demonstrate the potential of attention-based neural networks for revealing structure-property relationships and the underlying physical mechanisms, using the ferroelectric properties of PbTiO3 thin films as a case study. Through the analysis of attention scores, we disentangle the influence of distinct domain patterns on the polarization switching process. The attention-based Transformer model is explored both as a direct interpretability tool and as a surrogate for explaining representations learned via unsupervised machine learning, enabling the identification of physically grounded correlations. We compare attention-derived interpretability scores with classical SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and show that, in contrast to applications in natural language processing, attention mechanisms in materials science exhibit high efficiency in highlighting meaningful structural features.",

The model achieves high accuracy and computational efficiency and captures the full local chemical environment features of, currently, up to $f$ orbital matrix interaction blocks. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and transferability on several open materials benchmark datasets of two-dimensional materials and a new dataset for bulk gold, achieving sub-meV prediction errors on matrix elements and eigenvalues across all systems.

    "summary": "Altermagnetism, an unconventional magnetic phase characterized by zero net magnetism and a spin-split electronic band, has been studied exclusively in conventional crystalline materials. In this work, we extend the theoretical framework of altermagnetism to quasicrystals (QCs), which lack translational symmetry. We classify magnetic phases in 2D QCs with $n$-fold rotational symmetry without spin-orbit coupling, by using the irreducible representation (IRRP) of the $D_n$ point group. Based on symmetry analysis, we propose the conjecture that magnetic phases corresponding to 1D non-identity IRRPs are generally altermagnetic, with the exception of those possessing parity-time symmetry. To verify our conjecture, we take the Hubbard model as an example and develop a systematic approach to determine the magnetic pattern in the QC, which effectively avoids getting trapped at local energy minima. Consequently, our tests for the Hubbard model on various QCs with different symmetries are unexceptionally consistent with our proposal. Our work highlights the QC as a platform where the altermagnetism is common among magnetic phases.",

    "summary": "Halide vacancies are the dominant point defects in perovskites with VCl identified as a detrimental trap for the optoelectronic performance of CsPbCl3, with applications ranging from photodetectors to solar cells. Understanding these defects under operating conditions is key since their electronic levels exhibit large thermal fluctuations that challenge the validity of static 0 K models. However, quantitative modelling of defect processes requires hybrid density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling, which is too expensive for direct molecular dynamic simulations. To address this, we train a multi-task machine learning force field to study VCl in orthorhombic CsPbCl3 at 300 K. While we observe strong oscillations in the optical transition level arising from the soft potential energy surface, neither the non-radiative capture barriers nor the thermodynamic charge transition levels are affected. Our results reveal that VCl is not responsible for the non-radiative losses previously assumed. Instead, its impact on performance arises from other mechanisms, such as limiting the open-circuit voltage and promoting ionic migration. Our findings demonstrate that, despite strong dynamical effects in halide perovskites, the conventional static formalism of defect theory remains valid for predicting thermodynamic behavior, providing a sound basis for the design of high-performance energy materials.",

    "summary": "A new approach is proposed to assess the reliability of the truncated wavefunction methods by estimating the deviation from the full configuration interaction (FCI) wavefunction. While typical multireference diagnostics compare some derived property of the solution with the ideal picture of a single determinant, we try to answer a more practical question, how far is the solution from the exact one. Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to provide an approximate FCI solution for the self-consistently determined relevant active space, we compare the low-level CI expansions and one-body reduced density matrixes to determine the distance of the two solutions ($\\tilde{d}_\\Phi$, $\\tilde{d}_\\gamma$). We demonstrate the applicability of the approach for the CCSD method by benchmarking on the W4-17 dataset, as well as on transition metal-containing species. We also show that the presented moderate-cost, purely wavefunction-based metric is truly unique in the sense that it does not correlate with any popular multireference measures. We also explored the usage of CCSD natural orbitals ($\\tilde{d}_{\\gamma,\\mathrm{NO}}$) and its effect on the active space size and the metric. The proposed diagnostic can also be applied to other wavefunction approximations, and it has the potential to provide a quality measure for post-Hartree-Fock procedures in general.",

    "summary": "Polarons are widespread in functional materials and are key to device performance in several technological applications. However, their effective impact on material behavior remains elusive, as condensed matter studies struggle to capture their intricate interplay with atomic defects in the crystal. In this work, we present an automated workflow for modeling polarons within density functional theory (DFT). Our approach enables a fully automatic identification of the most favorable polaronic configurations in the system. Machine learning techniques accelerate predictions, allowing for an efficient exploration of the defect-polaron configuration space. We apply this methodology to Nb-doped TiO$_2$(110) surfaces, providing new insights into the role of defects in surface reactivity. Using CO adsorbates as a probe, we find that Nb doping has minimal impact on reactivity, whereas oxygen vacancies contribute significantly depending on their local arrangement via the stabilization of polarons on the surface atomic layer. Our package streamlines the modeling of charge trapping and polaron localization with high efficiency, enabling systematic, large-scale investigations of polaronic effects across complex material systems.",

Scaling predictions are therefore based on local structure and asymptotic assumptions, typically with classical methods being used to evaluate quantum simulators where possible.

Our observations run contrary to previous scaling predictions, demonstrating the need for caution when extrapolating the accuracy of classical simulations of quantum dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the virtuous cycle of competition between classical and quantum simulations can lend insight in both directions.",

Our approach combines unfitted finite element methods with both classical and tensor-based reduced basis techniques -- particularly the tensor-train reduced basis method -- to enable efficient and accurate model reduction on general geometries. To address the challenge of reconciling geometric variability with fixed-dimensional snapshot representations, we adopt a deformation-based strategy that maps a reference configuration to each parameterized domain. Furthermore, we introduce a localization procedure to construct dictionaries of reduced subspaces and hyper-reduction approximations, which are obtained via matrix discrete empirical interpolation in our work. We extend the proposed framework to saddle-point problems by adapting the supremizer enrichment strategy to unfitted methods and deformed configurations, demonstrating that the supremizer operator can be defined on the reference configuration without loss of stability. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional problems -- including Poisson, linear elasticity, incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations -- demonstrate the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology.",

    "summary": "We investigate the Nagaoka-Thouless (NT) ferromagnetic instability in the strongly interacting $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model by continuously breaking particle-hole symmetry on a tunable square-triangular lattice geometry. We use an analytic approach to show that the fully spin-polarized state becomes unstable to a metastable spin-polaron when the kinetic frustration $t'/t$ exceeds a critical, dimension-dependent value. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal a quantum phase transition from the NT ferromagnet to a spiral spin-density wave, which evolves continuously into the Haerter-Shastry antiferromagnet in the large-frustration limit. Remarkably, this transition remains robust at low but finite hole density, making it accessible in cold-atom and moir\\'e Hubbard platforms under strong interactions. A variational analysis further captures the instability mechanism at finite density via frustration-induced magnon band deformation.",

    "summary": "The discovery of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) nickelate superconductors under high pressure heralds a new chapter of high-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity. Recently, ambient-pressure superconductivity is achieved in R-P bilayer nickelate thin films through epitaxial compressive strain, unlocking in-depth investigations into the superconducting characteristics. Here, through electrical transport study, we report the observation of spin-glass superconductivity with hysteretic magnetoresistance and glass-like dynamics in the bilayer nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films. The superconductivity develops in a two-step transition, with onset Tc exceeding 50 K and zero-resistance Tc around 15 K. Remarkably, magnetoresistance hysteresis, indicative of time-reversal symmetry breaking, is observed exclusively during the second-step transition to zero resistance. The hysteresis is observed under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields with significant anisotropy, and exhibits coalescing minima at zero field, fundamentally distinct from trapped vortices or long-range-ordered magnetism with coercivity. Successive oxygen reductions simultaneously suppress the superconductivity and hysteresis, revealing their mutual connections to the selective electronic orbitals. The removal of magnetic field triggers spontaneous and logarithmically slow resistance relaxations in the second-step transition, signatures of glassy dynamics, indicating that the superconducting ground state is correlated with an electronic spin-glass order. Our findings uncover an unprecedented superconducting state in the nickelate superconductors, providing phenomenological and conceptual advances for future investigations on high-Tc superconductivity.",

    "summary": "We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\\tau\\times L\\times L = 660\\times66\\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \\qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.",

    "summary": "Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($>$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.",

The result is valence bands with opposite Chern numbers, $C^E=\\pm3$, and a magnon spectrum with a full topological gap and chiral bands, $C^M=\\pm1$. This work realizes topological altermagnonics in a tangible material platform, with a clear experimental fingerprint in the transverse thermal Hall effect.

Here, we introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network), which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the discovery of materials with tuned surface properties",

    "summary": "In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML) models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra in training ML models.",

By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers.

Contrary to earlier interpretations proposing a transient nonpolar intermediate phase, we demonstrate that the broad transitional regions previously observed in STEM images are projection artifacts resulting from the intrinsic three-dimensional zigzag morphology of 180$^\\circ$ domain walls, which are a characteristic form of inversion domain boundary. This is further confirmed by STEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films. Our simulations reveal that switching proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, directly explaining the emergence of zigzag-shaped domain walls, and is consistent with the nucleation-limited switching behavior observed in experimental switching dynamic measurements. Furthermore, we show that increasing Sc content systematically lowers domain wall energy and associated nucleation barrier, thereby reducing the switching field in agreement with experimental trends. These findings establish a direct connection between local domain wall structure, switching kinetics, and macroscopic ferroelectric behavior.",

In this work, we propose a general approach -- the statistics-encoded tensor network (SeTN) -- to study such systems. By encoding disorder into an auxiliary layer and averaging separately, SeTN restores translational invariance, enabling a well-defined transfer matrix formulation. We derive a universal criterion, $n \\gg \\alpha^2 t^2$, linking discretization $n$, disorder strength $\\alpha$, and evolution duration $t$. This sets the resolution required for faithful disorder averaging and shows that encoding is most efficient in the weak-disorder, typically chaotic regime. Applied to the disordered transverse-field Ising model, SeTN shows that the spectral form factor is governed by the leading transfer-matrix eigenvalue, in contrast to the kicked Ising model. SeTN thus provides a novel framework for probing the disorder-driven dynamical phenomena in many-body quantum systems.",

Conventional approaches for disordered materials involve sampling from thermodynamic ensembles and hoping for an experimental match. This process is inefficient and offers no guarantee of success. We present a method based on modified molecular dynamics, that we call molecular augmented dynamics (MAD), which identifies structures that simultaneously match multiple experimental observables and exhibit low energies as described by a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) trained from ab-initio data. We demonstrate its feasibility by finding representative structures of glassy carbon, nanoporous carbon, ta-C, a-C:D and a-CO$_x$ that match their respective experimental observables -- X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, pair distribution function and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data -- using the same initial structure and underlying MLP. The method is general, accepting any experimental observable whose simulated counterpart can be cast as a function of differentiable atomic descriptors. This method enables a computational \"microscope\" into experimental structures.",

In particular, a full characterization of universal dynamics of nonlocal correlation functions still remains largely unknown. In this letter, we uncover universal scaling laws of higher-order cumulants in one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, revealing anomalous behaviors of nonequilibrium dynamics exclusively accessible in higher-order correlations. By means of numerical simulations and full counting statistics, we determine the power laws of both the spin polarization transfer and contrast cumulants for different kinds of helix and domain-wall initial states. Building on such physical states, we unify the scaling behavior of the higher-order cumulants, giving rise to two types of dynamics: anomalous diffusive and superdiffusive. For the former, these higher cumulants show a deviation from Gaussian statistics, with the scaling exponents being identical for the first four orders. For the latter, however, we observe a breakdown of KPZ universality, with the exponents of the third and fourth orders differing significantly from those of the first two. Our results are also agreeable with recent experimental observations, advancing understanding of far-from-equilibrium transport phenomena.",

    "summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism, particularly 2D altermagnetism (AM), has attracted considerable interest due to its exceptional physical properties and broad application potential. However, the classification of AM undergoes a fundamental paradigm shift when transitioning from three-dimensional (3D) to 2D symmetry-enforced fully compensated collinear magnetism$-$a shift that has remained largely overlooked. Here, by extending unconventional magnetism to 2D collinear systems, we identify the symmetry conditions and electronic band characteristics of a distinct magnetic phase: type-IV magnetism. This new class lies beyond the established descriptions of ferromagnetism, conventional antiferromagnetism, and AM. Type-IV magnetism supports the successive emergence of both nonrelativistic spin-degenerate and relativistic spin-splitting phenomena, belonging strictly to neither conventional antiferromagnetism nor standard AM. We further establish a universal symmetry classification framework for 2D type-IV magnets via a mapping from the collinear spin layer group to the magnetic layer group. Monolayer MgCr$_2$O$_3$ and monolayer BaMn$_2$Ch$_3$ (Ch=Se, Te) are showcased as representative materials, exhibiting gate-tunable reversible spin textures and the quantum electric Hall effect, respectively. Our work underscores the rich functional prospects of type-IV magnets, offering a new route toward spin manipulation and anomalous transport that promises innovative designs for high-performance spintronic devices.",

These materials experience cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, causing complex degradation that traditional empirical models fail to capture accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy and generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and unirradiated conditions, the model outperforms traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and the conventional Neural Network. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis identifies strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and testing temperature as dominant features, each inversely correlated with fatigue life, consistent with physical understanding. PINN captures saturation behaviour in fatigue life at higher strain amplitudes in F/M steels. Overall, the PINN framework offers a reliable and interpretable approach for predicting fatigue life in irradiated alloys, enabling informed alloy selection.",

    "summary": "We study an extended spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice, which includes both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, as well as a scalar chiral term. This model exhibits a rich phase diagram featuring several competing phases: different quantum spin liquids and various magnetically ordered states, including coplanar $120^\\circ$ order, stripe order, and non-coplanar tetrahedral order. We employ large-scale matrix product state simulations optimized for GPUs to obtain high-resolution dynamical responses. Our calculations reveal the spectral features across both ordered and liquid regimes of the phase diagram, which we analyze in comparison with analytical predictions and field-theoretical approaches. We identify unique signatures of the ordered phases in the form of gapless Goldstone modes at the ordering wave vectors. Our results in the $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin-liquid regime are indicative of a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. In the chiral spin-liquid phase, we find signatures of spinons as the fractional excitations of the underlying theory, manifested as the onset of a two-spinon continuum that agrees with predictions from the Kalmeyer-Laughlin ansatz for the ground-state wave function, and collective modes that can be viewed as spinon bound states. We discuss finite-size effects, their consistency with the presumptions from field-theory, and review the dynamical structure factor with regard to experimentally relevant features such as the occurrence of highly dispersive signals and the global distribution of spectral weight.",

Our approach introduces two bosons to track both $Q\\rightleftharpoons Q\\pm1$ valence fluctuations and reduces to a single symmetric $s$-boson in the effective action, encoding all the high energy atomic physics information in the boson's kinematics, while the low energy part of the action remains unchanged across finite $U$, infinite $U$, and Kondo limits. We recover the infinite $U$ and Kondo limit actions from our approach and show that the Kondo resonance already develops in the normal state when the slave boson has yet to condense. We show that the slave rotor and $s$-boson have the same algebraic structure, and we establish a unified functional integral framework connecting the $s$-boson and slave rotor representations for the single impurity Anderson model.",

The system offers full polarization control in both excitation and detection, spatial scanning with micrometer resolution, and spectrally tunable excitation over a broad energy range from 0.5 to 4.0 eV, using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. Samples are mounted in a helium-flow cryostat, allowing temperature control from 4 to 300 K. Magnetic fields up to 0.625 T can be applied in the Voigt geometry via an electromagnet. The nonlinear optical signals are analyzed using a high-resolution spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 60 $\\mu$eV. We demonstrate the potential of the setup by means of SHG polarization tomography measurements on a Cu$_2$O crystal as well as through a SHG spectral scan of a ZnSe crystal over a wide energy range from 1.4 to 3.1 eV. Polarization-resolved confocal SHG mapping of various twisted mono- and bilayer MoS$_2$ structures is also presented. In addition, time-resolved two-color pump-probe experiments are shown for a Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ crystal, illustrating the potential of the system for investigating coherent exciton and phonon dynamics.",

Our tensor network computations however reveal that the superconducting correlations are strongly suppressed; while FM order stubbornly persists for the doped $K<0$ model, the doped $K>0$ model features emergent spin-charge modulated stripe orders. At higher hole doping for $K > 0$, where AFM order is more strongly suppressed than for the electron doped case, incorporating a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor attraction yields evidence for singlet $d$-wave superconductivity with Luttinger parameter $K_{\\rm sc} < 1$.

However, critical blind spots in their reliability persist. Here, we address one such significant gap by systematically investigating the accuracy of uMLIPs under extreme pressure conditions from 0 to 150 GPa. Our benchmark reveals that while these models excel at standard pressure, their predictive accuracy deteriorates considerably as pressure increases. This decline in performance originates from fundamental limitations in the training data rather than in algorithmic constraints. In fact, we show that through targeted fine-tuning on high-pressure configurations, the robustness of the models can be easily increased. These findings underscore the importance of identifying and addressing overlooked regimes in the development of the next generation of truly universal interatomic potentials.",

However, fully first-principles, self-consistent calculations with these dynamical functionals remain a major challenge, ultimately limiting their application to thermodynamic quantities, and restricting spectral predictions to one-shot calculations. In this paper, we present a fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solids using a dynamical functional. Our approach leverages the so-called dynamical Hubbard functional, which generalizes the DFT+$U$ correction by incorporating frequency-dependent screening, augmenting the static density functional to accurately describe both spectral and thermodynamic properties of materials with $d$- or $f$-localized orbitals near the Fermi level. To enable this, we employ the algorithmic-inversion method based on a sum-over-poles representation, resulting in a numerically accurate self-consistent scheme for frequency-integrated properties, while keeping real-axis spectral resolution for dynamically-resolved quantities. Using this framework, we study the paradigmatic correlated solid SrVO$_3$, accurately reproducing its spectral features, essentially confirming previous one-shot predictions, and improving the description of its equilibrium properties, such as the equilibrium volume and bulk modulus, bringing these significantly closer to experimental measurements.",

Compared to existing architectures, in a unitary network each local tensor is required to be a unitary matrix upon suitable reshaping. Global unitarity is ensured when the network obeys a suitable ordering property. Unitary operators represented by unitary networks need not preserve locality. In particular, we show that the class of unitary networks encompasses global unitaries which preserve locality up to exponentially suppressed tails, as in those that naturally arise from the finite-time evolution of local Hamiltonians. Non-invertible symmetries, as exemplified by the non-local Kramers-Wannier duality in one dimension, can also be represented using unitary networks.

    "summary": "The interplay of nanoscale electronic domains underpins many emergent phenomena of quantum materials, including the competition between charge density waves (CDW) and superconductivity in high-Tc cuprates, or the storage of information in phase-change memory devices. Coupling to electronic domains provides an observable for pinpointing key interactions, e.g. affecting phase transitions. While the equilibrium phase diagram of 1T-TaS2 - characterized by unique transport properties and varying degrees of CDW commensurability - has been studied extensively, an understanding of how the electronic domains in the bulk behave across phase boundaries is lacking. We reveal the three-dimensional evolution of electronic domains in 1T-TaS2 using temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and reciprocal space mapping, complemented by structure factor simulations based on the Hendricks-Teller method. With this methodology, we identify an increasing number of stacking faults near the phase transitions, and a growing fraction of dimerized layers in the commensurate phase upon cooling. We provide structural evidence that the CDW domains mediate the transport properties at phase boundaries, and that they also account for an anomalous intermediate electronic phase within the triclinic regime upon heating. As a paradigmatic material with potential in phase-change memory applications, our study underscores the importance of domain sizes and layer stacking in defining electronic behaviors of van der Waals materials.",

    "summary": "Recent years have enjoyed substantial progress in capturing properties of complex quantum systems by means of random tensor networks (RTNs), which form ensembles of quantum states that depend only on the tensor network geometry and bond dimensions. Of particular interest are RTNs on hyperbolic geometries, with local tensors typically chosen from the unitary Haar measure, that model critical boundary states of holographic bulk-boundary dualities. In this work, we elevate static pictures of ensemble averages to a dynamical one, to show that RTN states exhibit equilibration of time-averaged operator expectation values under a highly generic class of Hamiltonians with non-degenerate spectra. We prove that RTN states generally equilibrate at large bond dimension and also in the scaling limit for three classes of geometries: Those of matrix product states, regular hyperbolic tilings, and single \"black hole\" tensors. Furthermore, we prove a hierarchy of equilibration between finite-dimensional instances of these classes for bulk and boundary states with small entanglement. This suggests an equivalent hierarchy between corresponding many-body phases, and reproduces a holographic degree-of-freedom counting for the effective dimension of each system. These results demonstrate that RTN techniques can probe aspects of late-time dynamics of quantum many-body phases and suggest a new approach to describing aspects of holographic dualities using techniques from statistical mechanics.",

In the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decohered state resides on the self-dual critical line of the quantum Ashkin-Teller (qAT) model, as a result of the specific choice of the decoherence channel. On the other hand, since the mixed state under $X+ZZ$ decoherence satisfies the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in a weak sense, the Ising criticality of the pure state can be partially preserved in the mixed system. By making use of the combination of the doubled Hilbert space formalism and matrix product states, we carry out extensive numerical study to elucidate the mixed state criticality. We find that under decoherence up to moderate strength, the mixed states on the critical line have properties of the Ising CFT, where $c=1/2$, $\\eta=0.25$ and, $\\nu=1$. These values of the central charge and critical exponents contrast with the ones in the $c=1$ orbifold boson CFT describing the critical state of the qAT model. In addition, we also observe the threshold of the mixed Ising CFT. The strong decoherence washes out the remnant Ising criticality and induces strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking.",

All model parameters are extracted from density functional theory (DFT) calculations at a single twist angle (3.89{\\deg}) and monolayer data. Our model captures both lattice relaxation effects and the long-range behavior of piezoelectric and ferroelectric potentials. Leveraging lattice relaxations obtained via machine learning force fields (MLFFs), the model can be efficiently transferred to other twist angles without requiring additional DFT calculations. It accurately reproduces the DFT band dispersions and quantum geometries across a wide range of twist angles. Furthermore, our model reveals that a second flat Chern band arises near 2{\\deg} when the interlayer potential difference becomes comparable to the interlayer tunneling. This continuum model provides a clear understanding and starting point for engineering novel electronic phases in moir\\'e TMDs through twist angles and lattice relaxations.",

    "summary": "Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\\pi/4,\\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\\mu\\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM.",

    "summary": "In the last few years several ``universal'' interatomic potentials have appeared, using machine-learning approaches to predict energy and forces of atomic configurations with arbitrary composition and structure, with an accuracy often comparable with that of the electronic-structure calculations they are trained on. Here we demonstrate that these generally-applicable models can also be built to predict explicitly the electronic structure of materials and molecules. We focus on the electronic density of states (DOS), and develop PET-MAD-DOS, a rotationally unconstrained transformer model built on the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, and trained on the Massive Atomistic Diversity (MAD) dataset. We demonstrate our model's predictive abilities on samples from diverse external datasets, showing also that the DOS can be further manipulated to obtain accurate band gap predictions. A fast evaluation of the DOS is especially useful in combination with molecular simulations probing matter in finite-temperature thermodynamic conditions. To assess the accuracy of PET-MAD-DOS in this context, we evaluate the ensemble-averaged DOS and the electronic heat capacity of three technologically relevant systems: lithium thiophosphate (LPS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and a high entropy alloy (HEA). By comparing with bespoke models, trained exclusively on system-specific datasets, we show that our universal model achieves semi-quantitative agreement for all these tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can be performed using a small fraction of the bespoke data, yielding models that are comparable to, and sometimes better than, fully-trained bespoke models.",

Computing the experimentally measured observables directly in the thermodynamic limit with a priori control of systematic errors, we find striking agreement with the experimental data across all accessible temperatures -- including the lowest, where existing numerical benchmarks show significant deviations. This validates the quantum simulator's control over systematic errors in this challenging regime and delivers unbiased benchmarks for future method development. Our results demonstrate that classical algorithms remain competitive with state-of-the-art analogue quantum simulators, and emphasise the importance of controlled numerical methods for continuing the development of these experiments.",

Incorporation of such intriguing compounds into low-dimensional structures represents an important avenue towards exploiting and enhancing their functionalities. Prominent examples of this group are semiconductors well suited to the band-gap engineering strategies. Here, we present for the first time visible-light-emitting CdSe quantum wells, in which wurtzite MnSe as an alermagnetic candidate plays the role of a barrier. Photoluminescence experiments with temporal resolution demonstrate that in such quantum wells, a built-in electric field is present and strongly influences the energies of the emitted photons, the dynamics of recombination, and excitation power dependence. Numerical simulations allow us to estimate that the magnitude of the electric field is 14MV/m. We anticipate that such quantum wells offer potential to probe the barrier properties and that wurtzite MnSe is an interesting platform to study the interplay of the altermagnetism and built-in electric field.",

We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in altermagnetic systems.",

Since entanglement threads are naturally and closely related to tensor network states, the results are argued to imply the existence of the perfect-type entanglement formed jointly by the entanglement threads crossing the wormhole and the internal threads in the single-sided boundary.

    "summary": "We report a comprehensive bulk characterization and neutron scattering investigation of single-crystalline Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, a magnetic pyrochlore synthesized via a flux-growth method. Unpolarized neutron diffuse scattering reveals the emergence of spin-ice correlations below $T \\sim 1$ K, evidenced by the development of anisotropic pinch-point features that are consistent with quantum-spin-ice (QSI) behavior. A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete spin freezing below $T_f \\approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T = 0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below $T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate, and a gapped excitation centered at $\\hbar\\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow component $\\tau_{\\mathrm{slow}} \\sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component $\\tau_{\\mathrm{fast}} \\sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for QSI systems. Taken together, these results indicate that Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ enters a disorder-induced spin-frozen phase below $T_f$, lying in close proximity to a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.",

The stacking sequences explored are inspired by the possible use of MXenes as precursors to enable relatively low temperature processing of high-temperature ceramics. We identified 67 new hexagonal, layered materials with thermal stability comparable or better than previously observed zeta phases. To assess their potential for high temperature applications, we used machine learning and physics-based models with DFT inputs to predict their melting temperatures and discovered several candidates on par with the current state of the art zeta-like phases and five with predicted melting temperatures above 2500 K. The findings expand the range of chemistries and structures for high-temperature applications.",

These materials can be broadly classified into two categories based on the behavior of spin splitting at time-reversal-related momenta: even-parity and odd-parity altermagnets. While even-parity altermagnets have been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally, the systems capable of hosting odd-parity altermagnetism remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light dynamically converts collinear PT-symmetric antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices into odd parity p-wave altermagnets. Because of the underlying Dirac band structure of the dimerized lattice, we find that the resulting p-wave altermagnets can realize Chern insulators (2D) and Weyl semimetals (3D) under appropriate drive conditions. Our findings demonstrate that collinear antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices provide ideal platforms to investigate the dynamical generation of odd-parity altermagnetism.",

In plasticity, these models often rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases, temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.",

    "summary": "Directional solidification of water-based solutions has emerged as a versatile technique for templating hierarchical porous materials. However, the underlying mechanisms of pattern formation remain incompletely understood. In this work, we present a detailed derivation and analysis of a quantitative phase-field model for simulating this nonequilibrium process. The phase-field model extends the thin-interface formulation of dilute binary alloy solidification with anti-trapping to incorporate the highly anisotropic energetic and kinetic properties of the partially faceted ice-water interface. This interface is faceted in the basal plane normal to the <0001> directions and atomically rough in other directions within the basal plane. On the basal plane, the model reproduces a linear or nonlinear kinetic relationship that can be linked to experimental measurements. In both cases, spontaneous parity breaking of the solidification front is observed, leading to the formation of partially faceted ice lamellae that drift laterally in one of the <0001> directions. We demonstrate that the drifting velocity is controlled by the kinetics on the basal plane and converges as the thickness of the diffuse solid-liquid interface decreases. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the form of the kinetic anisotropy, which is chosen here such that the inverse of the kinetic coefficient varies linearly from a finite value in the <0001> directions to zero in all other directions within the basal plane. Our results indicate that the drifting velocity of ice lamellae is not affected by the slope of this linear relation, and the radius and undercooling at the tip of an ice lamella converge at relatively small slope values. Consequently, the phase-field simulations remain quantitative with computationally tractable choices of both the interface thickness and the slope assumed in the form of the kinetic anisotropy.",

Although the precise boundary of this subset remains unknown, certain constraints are recognized; for instance, holographic entropies obey inequalities that are violated by general quantum states such as the GHZ states. This paper, however, presents a gravity dual for GHZ states -- a non-ordinary geometry termed the booklet wormhole. We demonstrate an exact match for all entropy properties with the GHZ state, as well as the identity of the Euclidean partition functions for both systems. The booklet wormhole circumvents the conventional holographic entropy inequalities because different topologies are inevitably included in the gravitational path integral, even in the large-$N$ limit. This provides the first explicit holographic duality with a non-perturbative quantum effect. Remarkably, the construction is simple and maximally entangled, making it ideal for gedanken experiments.",

    "summary": "We introduce a versatile and scalable framework for constructing effective models of superconducting (SC) nanostructures described by the generalized SC Anderson impurity model with multiple quantum dots and leads. Our Chain Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with parameters obtained from Pad\\'e approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient simulations: short chains are tractable with exact diagonalization, and longer ones with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular phases differ substantially with dot number. Here, large parameter regions are entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for exploring complex SC nanostructures.",

    "summary": "We study the isotropic spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J>0$): a \\textit{Kondo phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\\ln 2$ at $T \\to \\infty$ to $0$ at $T\\to 0$; and an \\textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound mode drives $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\\ln 2$ as $T \\to \\infty$ and to $0$ as $T \\to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J<0$): a local-moment (LM) phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}\\to \\ln 2$ as $T \\to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at intermediate scales; and a \\textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at strong $|J|$, where $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}=\\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots occur for all $J<0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as $J\\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact diagonalization results.",

    "summary": "Governed by specific symmetries, altermagnetism is an emerging field in condensed matter physics, characterized by unique spin-splitting of the bands in the momentum space co-existing with the compensated magnetization as in antiferromagnets. As crystals can have tailored and unintended defects, it is important to gain insights on how altermagnets are affected by the defects-driven symmetry-breaking which, in turn, can build promising perspectives on potential applications. In this study, considering the widely investigated MnTe as a prototype altermagnet, defects are introduced through substitutional doping to create a large configuration space of spin space groups. With the aid of density functional theory calculations, symmetry analysis, and model studies in this configuration space, we demonstrate the generic presence of spin-split of the antiferromagnetic bands in the momentum space. This is indicative of a wider class of quasi-altermagnetic materials, augmenting the set of ideal altermagnetic systems. Furthermore, we show that while pristine MnTe does not show anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) with out-of-plane magnetization, suitable doping can be carried out to obtain finite and varied AHC. Our predictions of quasi-altermagnetism and doping driven tailored AHC have the potential to open up as-yet-unexplored directions in this developing field.",

    "summary": "Understanding hydrogen diffusion is critical for improving the reliability and performance of oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs), where hydrogen plays a key role in carrier modulation and bias instability. In this work, we investigate hydrogen diffusion in amorphous IGZO ($a$-IGZO) and $c$-axis aligned crystalline IGZO (CAAC-IGZO) using machine learning interatomic potential molecular dynamics (MLIP-MD) simulations. We construct accurate phase-specific MLIPs by fine-tuning SevenNet-0, a universal pretrained MLIP, and validate the models against a comprehensive dataset covering hydrogen-related configurations and diffusion environments. Hydrogen diffusivity is evaluated over 650--1700 K, revealing enhanced mobility above 750 K in $a$-IGZO due to the glassy matrix, while diffusion at lower temperatures is constrained by the rigid network. Arrhenius extrapolation of the diffusivity indicates that hydrogen in $a$-IGZO can reach the channel/insulator interface within $10^{4}$ seconds at 300--400 K, likely contributing to negative bias stress-induced device degradation. Trajectory analysis reveals that long-range diffusion in $a$-IGZO is enabled by a combination of hydrogen hopping and flipping mechanisms. In CAAC-IGZO, hydrogen exhibits high in-plane diffusivity but severely restricted out-of-plane transport due to a high energy barrier along the $c$-axis. This limited vertical diffusion in CAAC-IGZO suggests minimal impact on bias instability. This work bridges the atomic-level hydrogen transport mechanism and device-level performance in oxide TFTs by leveraging large-scale MLIP-MD simulations.",

    "summary": "The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review, we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs, including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities, ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way, and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions for the theory of deep NNs.",

    "summary": "Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\\pi/4,\\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\\mu\\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM.",

    "summary": "In recent years, charge-channel orders in strongly correlated metals have attracted great attention. Famous examples are the electronic nematic orders in cuprates and iron-based superconductors, and Star-of-David order in kagome metals. Critical phenomena and unconventional superconductivity arising from fluctuations of such charge-channel orders are central issues today; however, the essential role is played by the vertex corrections, which are the many-body effects that are dropped in conventional mean-field type approximations. To solve this difficulty, in this study, we propose the Bethe-Salpeter equation theory to evaluate electron-electron interactions in two dimensional Hubbard models. This method satisfies the criteria of the Baym-Kadanoff conserving approximation. Here, we find that an attractive interaction in the charge channel emerges from the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex corrections that describe the interference processes among spin fluctuations. Applying this method to the square-lattice Hubbard model, we reveal that the cooperation of attractive charge fluctuations and repulsive spin fluctuations yields high-$T_c$ $d$-wave superconductivity together with enhanced effective mass. These results naturally explain the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors, where strong-coupling $d$-wave superconductivity appears near the charge-order quantum critical point. The theory can also be applied to multi-orbital Hubbard models, like iron-based and nickelate superconductors, suggesting broad potential for future applications.",

We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in altermagnetic systems.",

Here, we present an accurate and transferable machine-learned potential (MLP) for the tungsten-hydrogen binary system within the neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework, trained through active learning on extensive density functional theory data. The developed NEP-WH model reproduces a wide range of lattice and defect properties in tungsten systems, as well as hydrogen solubility, with near first-principles accuracy, while retaining the efficiency of empirical potentials. Crucially, it is the first MLP capable of capturing hydrogen trapping and H\\textsubscript{2} formation in nanovoids, with quantitative fidelity. Large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations reveal a distinct aggregation pathway where planar hydrogen clusters nucleate and grow along \\{100\\} planes near voids, with hexagonal close-packed structures emerging at their intersections. Under uniaxial tension, these aggregates promote bubble fracture and the development of regular \\{100\\} cracks, suppressing dislocation activity and resulting in brittle fracture behavior. This work provides detailed atomistic insights into hydrogen bubble evolution and fracture in nanovoids, enables predictive modeling of structural degradation in extreme environments, and advances fundamental understanding of hydrogen-induced damage in structural metals.",

    "summary": "Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in controlling the physical properties of complex oxides. In La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\\delta}, the topotactic phase transition from Perovskite (PV) to Brownmillerite (BM) can be triggered e.g. via oxygen removal during thermal annealing. Here we report on a very efficient thermal vacuum annealing method using aluminum as an oxygen getter material. The topotactic phase transition is characterized by X-ray Diffraction which confirms a successful transition from PV to BM in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\\delta} thin films grown via physical vapor deposition. The efficiency of this method is confirmed using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\\delta} micron-sized bulk powder. The accompanying transition from the original Ferromagnetic (FM) to an Antiferromagnetic (AF) state and the simultaneous transition from a metallic to an insulating state is characterized using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)-magnetometry and Alternating Current (AC) resistivity measurements, respectively. The near surface manganese oxidation states are probed by synchrotron X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. Moreover, X-ray Reflectivity, Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy reveal surface segregation and cation redistribution during the oxygen getter assisted annealing process.",

Recent neural network models have shown promise in overcoming these challenges, but typically require large datasets and lack physical interpretability. Physics-inspired approximate models offer greater data efficiency and intuitive understanding, but often sacrifice accuracy and transferability. Here we present HAMSTER, a physics-informed machine learning framework for predicting the quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of complex chemical systems. Starting from an approximate model encoding essential physical effects, HAMSTER captures the critical influence of dynamic environments on Hamiltonians using only few explicit first-principles calculations. We demonstrate our approach on halide perovskites, achieving accurate prediction of optoelectronic properties across temperature and compositional variations, and scalability to systems containing tens of thousands of atoms. This work highlights the power of physics-informed Hamiltonian learning for accurate and interpretable optoelectronic property prediction in large, complex systems.",

    "summary": "The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs. LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Traj and https://github.com/LeMaterial/lematerial-fetcher.",

One common approach to many-body non-Hermitian (NH) systems is to incorporate the anti-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian directly in the Matsubara Green's function. Here, we show that such an approach is incompatible with the standard framework for systems with interactions. Furthermore, we furnish a consistent physical description for such systems by determining their distinction from conventional interacting physics, and find that they are described by pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we characterize the zero-temperature distribution functions within several frameworks for NH systems. As an application of our results, we consider the electromagnetic response of a NH quasiparticle Hamiltonian based on the (1+1)-dimensional NH Dirac model subject to various physical descriptions.",

    "summary": "We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.   We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experimental data.   Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.   At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.",

This paper presents an efficient solver for dynamical mean field theory using configuration interaction (CI).

Hence, it provides an accessible, open-source alternative that can be executed on standard laptop computers or on supercomputers. The solver is demonstrated on cerium in the $\\gamma$-, $\\alpha$- and $\\epsilon$-phases. An analysis of how the electronic structure of Ce evolves as function of lattice compression is made. It is argued that the electronic structure evolves from a localized nature of the 4f shell in $\\gamma$-Ce to an essentially itinerant nature of the 4f shell of $\\epsilon$-Ce. The transition between these two phases, as function of compression, can hence be seen as a Mott transition. However, this transition is intercepted by the strongly correlated $\\alpha$-phase of elemental Ce, for which the 4f shell forms a Kondo singlet.",

This study presents a novel integration of machine learning-guided hydrothermal aging with multiscale characterization to resolve a two-stage degradation mechanism in 3 mol% YSZ. Stage 1 (0 to 30 hrs) features initial surface relief building, which transitions to partial refinement and relief distribution in stage 2 (30 to 60 hrs), alongside a rise in monoclinic phase content. The evolving microstructure increases triple-junction grain boundary density, and these junctions act as degradation hotspots, where vacancy exchange and water access accelerate the transformation. These findings highlight grain boundary chemistry, rather than grain size alone, as a key LTD driver, suggesting boundary engineering as a strategy to enhance YSZ stability for energy, biomedical, and thermal applications.",

A common strategy is to embed the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two physically relevant parameters, correlation length and mixing time, and explore whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales. Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations, classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.",

Here we develop a qubit parametrization of the gauge constrained algorithm of VDAT at \\mathcal{N}=3 for the multiorbital Hubbard model with general density-density interactions. The qubit parametrization yields an explicit variational trial energy, and the variational parameters consist of the momentum density distribution, the shape of a reference fermi surface, and the pure state of a qubit system with dimension of the local Hilbert space. To illustrate the power of the qubit parametrization, we solve for the ground state properties of the multiorbital Hubbard model with Hund coupling for local orbital number N_{orb}=2-7. A Taylor series expansion of the partially optimized trial energy is used to explain how the Hund's coupling changes the order of the Mott transition. For the case of the SU(2N_{orb}) Hubbard model, an explicit approach for computing the critical U_{c} for the Mott transition is provided, yielding an analytical expression for U_{c} in the large N_{orb} limit. Additionally, we provide an analytical solution for the ground state properties of the single band Hubbard model with a special density of states. Finally, we demonstrate that the qubit parametrization can also be applied to \\mathcal{N}=2, for both G-type and B-type variants, where the G-type yields an identical expression to the slave spin mean-field theory. The qubit parametrization not only improves the efficiency and transparency of VDAT at \\mathcal{N}=3, but also provides the key advances for the construction of a one-body reduced density matrix functional capable of capturing Mott and Hund physics.",

We formulate this task as an optimization problem over orthogonal matrices acting on a single tensor's indices, aiming to minimize the rank of its matricized form. We present Riemannian optimization methods and a joint optimization framework that alternates between optimizing the orthogonal transformation for a fixed low-rank approximation and optimizing the low-rank approximation for a fixed orthogonal transformation, offering a competitive alternative when the target rank is known. To seek the often unknown optimal rank, we introduce a binary search strategy integrated with the disentangling procedure.

In this work, we develop a machine learning framework that predicts EDS spectra directly from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, reducing beam exposure and acquisition time. A convolutional neural network (CNN) accurately infers elemental compositions, particularly for elements with strong diffraction contrast or higher concentrations, such as Oxygen and Tellurium. Both extrapolation and interpolation strategies demonstrate consistent performance, with improved predictions when additional structural context is available. Visual and cross-correlation analyses confirm the model's ability to capture global and local compositional trends.

This presents an uncommon case where repulsion leads to zero-energy edge states. Upon increasing U further, the edge state energy starts increasing again until they are lost in the bulk. However, upon increasing U even further, these edge states reappear in the high energy gap.

However, these approaches currently lack optimal analytical methods to compute design parameters with low optical depth. In this work, we introduce a constructive decomposition of unitary matrices using a sequence of $2N+5$ phase masks interleaved with $2N+4$ discrete Fourier transform matrices. This decomposition can be leveraged to design universal interferometers based on phase masks and multimode interference couplers, implementing a discrete Fourier transform, offering an analytical alternative to conventional numerical optimization-based designs.",

    "summary": "Entangled quantum mechanical states in one dimension can be used to represent and simulate classical stochastic processes with nontrivial statistical properties. Long-range quantum correlations translate into fractional processes with their asymptotic Hurst exponents characterizing roughness and persistence. We explore this analogy in the case of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain and investigate properties of four different classical two-state processes that this quantum system can generate. These processes show fractional characteristics with varying Hurst exponents. We argue that the continuous quantum symmetries such as U(1) or SU(2) of the XXZ chain give rise to $H=0$ with logarithmic scaling. Processes generated without these symmetries can produce $H \\geq0.5$ but likely not $H < 0.5$ unless the dominant term responsible for $H=0.5$ gets canceled. This does not seem to happen for the XXZ model. We use standard quantum methods, including MERA and TEBD, to numerically substantiate our findings.",

These algorithms are particularly well-suited to circuits with high rates of Pauli measurements, such as those encountered in quantum error correction and monitored quantum circuits. The measurements serve to limit the buildup of magic induced by non-Clifford operations arising from generic noise processes or unitary gates, respectively. Our algorithms also allow a systematic truncation procedure to achieve approximate simulation. To benchmark our approach, we study the dynamics of all-to-all monitored quantum circuits with a sub-extensive rate of $T$-gates per unit of circuit depth, where we can simulate previously inaccessible system sizes and depths. We characterize measurement-induced phase transitions in the output wavefunction, including in the entanglement, purification, and magic. We outline the utility of our algorithms to simulate dynamics with low magic and high entanglement, complementary to the leading matrix-product state approaches.",

Our approach is tailored for digital quantum computers with restricted qubit connectivity, a common limitation in state-of-the-art hardware platforms.

For the linear configuration, we use a variant of the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithm to demonstrate that our protocol is independent of the qubits' number. A slight modification of the protocol reveals the presence of quantum states that exhibit periodicity of entanglement among nearest-neighbor qubits.

    "summary": "We propose a four-stroke quantum thermal machine based on the 1D anyon Hubbard model, which is capable of extracting the excess energy arising from anyon exclusion statistics at low temperature into finite work. Defining a hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low temperature work, in the absence of any interactions, is maximised in the pseudo fermionic limit, where the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or pseudo-fermionic extremes, but instead peaks at intermediate statistical angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions, in this regime. Furthermore, we also identify different modes of operation of the HAO cycle, one of which emerges as a direct consequence of the finite anyon energy at low temperature.",

While FAs were observed in exemplary Weyl semimetal TaAs and Co3Sn2S2, the manipulation of FAs has been rarely explored. Here we take Co3Sn2S2 as an example and demonstrate that tuning the electronic correlation strength is an effective way to control the topology and connectivity of FAs. After achieving a good agreement with experimentally measured band structure by employing combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we show that the experimental charge dynamics are well reproduced by DFT+DMFT calculations but not DFT calculations. Electronic correlation renormalizes the bands around the Fermi level and modifies the energy and location of Weyl points, and the resulting FAs. In particular, on the Co-terminated surface, the FAs are formed by connecting Weyl points located in adjacent Brillouin zones in DFT+DMFT calculations and experiments, in strong contrast to the FAs connecting Weyl points within the same Brillouin zone in DFT calculations. We further show the evolution of FAs with correlation and reveal a topological change of the FAs on the Sn-terminated surface at stronger correlation strength. Our study sheds new light on experimental manipulation of FAs to improve the electronic properties of correlated Weyl semimetals.",

    "summary": "Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies, a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19 state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication: models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below 6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.",

For computational efficiency these descriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine features often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image sizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we train a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large patch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We apply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently featurise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant cells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of these upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like hairline cracks. We demonstrate that interactive segmentation with these deep features produces high-quality segmentations far faster and with far fewer labels than training or finetuning a more traditional convolutional network.",

    "summary": "Within the framework of imaginary-time evolution for matrix product states, we introduce a cluster version of the infinite time-evolving block decimation algorithm for simulating quantum many-body systems, addressing the computational accuracy challenges in strongly correlated physics. By redefining the wave-function ansatz to incorporate multiple physical degrees of freedom, we enhance the representation of entanglement, thereby improving the accuracy of the ground states. Utilizing the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition and optimized truncation schemes, our method maintains roughly the same computational complexity while capturing more quantum correlations. We apply this approach to three nontrivial cases: the gapless spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the spin-1 anisotropic XXZD chain with a higher-order Gaussian-type phase transition, and a spin-1/2 twisted triangular prism hosting a magnetic plateau phase. Improved accuracy in physical quantities, such as magnetization, ground-state energy, and entanglement entropy, has been demonstrated. This method provides a scalable framework for studying complex quantum systems with high precision, making it suitable for situations where a pure increase in bond dimension alone cannot guarantee satisfactory results.",

    "summary": "In ordered quantum magnets where interactions between elementary excitations dominate over their kinetic energy, perturbative approaches often fail, making non-perturbative methods essential to capture spectral features such as bound states and the redistribution of weight within excitation continua. Although an increasing number of experiments report anomalous spin excitation continua in such systems, their microscopic interpretation remains an open challenge. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in its 1/3-plateau phase using two complementary non-perturbative approaches: exact diagonalization in a truncated Hilbert space for a gas of elementary excitations (THED) and matrix product state (MPS) simulations. Alongside cross-validation between these methods, we benchmark our results against inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data. The THED analysis confirms the presence of two-magnon bound states and identifies the anomalous scattering continuum observed in both MPS and INS as a two-magnon resonance, arising from hybridization between the bound state and the two-magnon continuum. Furthermore, THED reveals bound states overlapping with the continuum, enriching the interpretation of continuum anomalies. More broadly, THED provides a robust framework for investigating anomalous spin excitation continua and bound-state effects in other materials with gapped spectra. Its combination of accuracy and computational efficiency makes it a powerful tool for extracting reliable microscopic models in semiclassical regimes.",

Using an X-ray free-electron laser probe, the evolution of individual 111 Bragg peaks is measured as a function of delay time at various laser fluences. Above a laser fluence threshold at a sufficient pump-probe delay, the Bragg peak splits into multiple peaks, indicating heterogeneous strain, before returning to a single peak, corresponding to even heat distribution throughout the lattice expanded crystal. Our findings are supported by a lattice displacement and strain model of a single nanocrystal at different delay times, which agrees with the experimental data. Our observations have implications for understanding femtosecond laser interactions with metals and the potential photo-catalytic performance of Pd.",

    "summary": "According to classical Miedema theory, reducing crystals to the order of nanometer sizes might greatly modulate the mixing enthalpy of elements, thus enabling the invention of a lot of new bulk-immiscible alloys. Although numerous alloys with higher mixing enthalpies remain unexplored, this strategy is approaching its limit, as reflected by the critical diameter of recent alloys of 1.8 nm, which corresponds to ~150 atoms and hardly provides a crystalline order. Future development requires not only even smaller atomic-scale control but also a new surface energy-saving mechanism. Here, we report the formation of W-Cu nanoalloys with a very large miscibility gap in the bulk via the use of an atomically size-selected cluster beam source as an example. The face-centered cubic (FCC) structure was demonstrated through electron diffraction, which indicated a lattice constant of 3.88{\\AA} for W0.85Cu0.15 nanoalloys (~2280 atoms). In this comprehensive study that covers a large parameter space of W/Cu compositions and numbers of atoms, an asymmetric miscibility nanophase diagram in which W-rich compositions favor mixing and the critical size is approximately 6000 atoms, which far exceeds the approximately tens of atoms predicted via classical theory, was obtained for the first time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a mutual strain-induced mechanism that simultaneously lowers the surface energies while reducing the size to the atomic scale. This approach paves the way for the development of new high-performance nonequilibrium phase alloys.",

Strong correlation in chemical systems are prevalent and present a formidable challenge in the simulation of these systems, while predictive phenomena in this domain often also requires a demanding level of accuracy to inform chemical behavior. Efficient representations of the many-electron states of chemical systems are therefore also being inspired by machine learning principles to provide an alternative to established approaches. In this chapter, we review recent progress in this endeavor for quantum chemical problems represented in second quantization, and the particular challenges present in this field. In particular, we focus on the application of Gaussian Process States emerging from efficient representations of the many-body wavefunction with rigorous Bayesian modeling frameworks, allowing for the unification of multiple paradigms under a common umbrella. We show how such models (and other representations derived from machine learning) can be used as novel tools to compute ab initio chemical properties, while in turn also informing the design of machine learning models to extract correlation patterns in classical data.",

    "summary": "The precise understanding of adsorption energetics and molecular geometry at catalytic sites is fundamental for advancing catalysis, particularly under the constraints of resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. This study benchmarks the performance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations against diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for adsorption properties of small gas molecules relevant to CO oxidation -- namely O$_2$, CO, CO$_2$, and atomic oxygen -- on a single Pt atom supported by pristine graphene. Our findings reveal that DMC calculations provide a significantly different landscape of adsorption energetics compared to DFT results. Notably, DFT predicts different lowest-energy configurations and spin states, particularly for O$_2$, which suggests potential discrepancies in predicting the catalytic behavior. Furthermore, this study identifies the critical issue of CO poisoning, highlighted by the large disparity between the DMC adsorption energies of O$_2$ ($-1.23(2)$ eV) and CO ($-3.37(1)$ eV), which can inhibit the catalytic process. These results emphasize the necessity for more sophisticated computational approaches in catalysis research, aiming to refine the prediction accuracy of reaction mechanisms and to enhance the design of more effective catalysts.",

    "summary": "As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing and controlling the quantum circuits grows exponentially. Manually optimizing these circuits becomes infeasible. Optimizing entanglement distribution in large-scale quantum circuits is critical for enhancing the sensitivity and efficiency of quantum sensors [5], [6]. This paper presents an engineering integration of reinforcement learning with tensor-network-based simulation (MPS) for scalable circuit optimization for optimizing quantum sensor circuits with up to 60 qubits. To enable efficient simulation and scalability, we adopt tensor network methods, specifically the Matrix Product State (MPS) representation, instead of traditional state vector or density matrix approaches. Our reinforcement learning agent learns to restructure circuits to maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy while reducing gate counts and circuit depth. Experimental results show consistent improvements, with QFI values approaching 1, entanglement entropy in the 0.8-1.0 range, and up to 90% reduction in depth and gate count. These results highlight the potential of combining quantum machine learning and tensor networks to optimize complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.",

These rules form a term rewriting system, a formal method for deriving equivalences by repeatedly applying substitutions. We construct an efficiently implementable quantum Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the entire class of equivalent expressions - potentially exponentially many - in a quantum superposition. By preparing and manipulating these ground states, we address fundamental problems in equational reasoning, including the word problem, i.e., determining whether two expressions are equivalent, counting the number of equivalent expressions, and identifying structural properties of equivalence classes. We demonstrate a quantum-inspired version of the algorithm using tensor network simulations by solving instances involving up to $10^{28}$ equivalent expressions, well beyond the reach of standard classical graph exploration techniques. This framework opens the path for quantum symbolic computation in areas ranging from quantum and logical circuit design to data compression, computational group theory, linguistics, polymers and biomolecular modeling, enabling the investigation of problems previously out of reach.",

    "summary": "We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.   We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experimental data.   Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.   At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.",

We focus in particular on the localization and coherence behavior of the model, extending our previous study at low temperature [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056502 (2025)]. As the temperature increases, the system becomes less localized and less coherent. The loss of coherence, which is controlled by two independent mechanisms -- a smooth damping-driven crossover and a sharp frequency-driven transition -- exhibits a nontrivial temperature dependence. While both types of coherence loss occur at lower coupling in the high temperature regime, the frequency exhibits a sharper drop at high temperatures and this drop is observed for all values of the sub-Ohmic exponent, in contrast to the zero-temperature case. We discuss the full temperature-dependent dynamical phase diagram of the system and the interplay between coherence and localization across a wide range of physical parameters.",

We present a joint theoretical and experimental exploration of possible signatures of fermion pairing with finite center-of-mass momentum, or the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) order. Experimentally a doped and spin-imbalanced attractive two-dimensional Hubbard model is realized with a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice, and quantum gas microscopy is used to probe its properties. Computationally we study the same model with state-of-the-art constrained-path (CP) auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). Direct comparisons between experiment and computation on various short-range magnetic and charge correlations show excellent agreement. We then investigate these correlations, as well as pairing correlation functions, systematically to low temperatures with CP-AFQMC, and determine parameter regimes in density and magnetization where signatures of FFLO order may be observed. We show that the temperature at which precursors of such orders appear is already within reach of the current experiment. We discuss routes for direct experimental detection and measurements of such states.",

    "summary": "Demonstrating superconductivity in purely repulsive Hubbard models is a compelling goal which underscores the counter-intuitive ability of Coulomb interactions to mediate superconductivity. Here, we present numerical evidence for robust superconductivity in a triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model at $\\pi/2$ flux per plaquette. Employing infinite density matrix renormalization group calculations on infinite cylinders of finite circumference, we observe superconducting ground states for a wide range of dopings, whose pair-correlations strengthen as the 2D limit is approached. At a density of one electron per site, Hubbard interactions have been reported to drive the insulating parent state of the superconductor from an integer quantum Hall (IQH) state to a chiral spin liquid (CSL). Our findings give credence to a recent proposal that proximity to the IQH-CSL transition serves to make chiral superconductivity energetically favorable on doping, and also correctly predicts the nature of the edge modes in the superconductor. On the CSL side, this suggests the superconductor can be thought of as arising from Laughlin's `anyon superconductivity' mechanism. Thus the Hubbard-Hofstadter model studied here offers a clean and experimentally accessible setup, potentially realizable in moir\\'e heterostructures, for exploring the properties of anyonic matter at finite density and the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality and superconductivity.",

    "summary": "Superconductor research has traditionally depended on experiments and theoretical approaches. However, the rapid advancement of data-driven methods and machine learning (ML) has opened avenues for accelerating superconductor discovery. Here, we integrated ML with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to efficiently screen conventional B-C-N based superconductors and identify potential high-TC candidates among R3Ni2O7-type bilayer nickelates. We identified 12 new binary and ternary B-C-N based superconductors with TC >= 10 K, including 3 with TC >= 25 K, such as two structural forms of B2CN (TC = 44.8 K and 41.5 K) and TiNbN2 (TC = 26.2 K). These materials share a common feature of strong {\\sigma}-bonds, which is key to achieving relatively high TC. Moreover, we proposed Tb3Ni2O7 (TC = 61.6 K) and Ac3Ni2O7 (TC = 70.3 K) as potential high-TC nickelate superconductors under high pressure. Their electronic structures closely resemble those of La3Ni2O7, especially in the hole-type band dominated by Ni-3dz2 orbital character. We also analyzed feature importance in the ML results for both conventional and high-TC superconductors. These results advance the search for new superconductors and enhance the fundamental understanding of superconducting mechanisms.",

    "summary": "We propose an inexact low-rank source iteration with diffusion synthetic acceleration (SI-DSA) for solving the multidimensional steady-state radiative transfer equation (RTE) in the second-order formulation. The angular flux is represented in either a low-rank matrix or hierarchical Tucker tensor (HTT) format, enabling substantial reductions in computational resources. Each SI step is solved using a preconditioned low-rank conjugate gradient (CG) method with a diffusion preconditioner. To further improve efficiency, we introduce an adaptive inexact strategy that dynamically relaxes the inner CG tolerance during early SI iterations. The method exploits the tensor-product structure of the discretized operators to perform all matrix-vector operations in low-rank form. Numerical experiments on 2D2V benchmark problems, including diffusion-dominated, transport-dominated, and multiscale problems, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-5}$ relative to full-rank reference solutions, while reducing the degrees of freedom by up to two orders of magnitude. In the diffusion-dominated case, the low-rank solver achieves speedups exceeding $90\\times$ over its full-rank counterpart and remains competitive in solving challenging transport-dominated and multiscale problems while providing substantial storage savings. To our knowledge, this work provides the first low-rank SI-DSA framework for multidimensional steady-state RTE.",

These include the putative quantum spin liquids (QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials.",

    "summary": "The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), a manifestation of broken centrosymmetry, has attracted interest as a probe of the symmetry and quantum geometry of materials, and for use in novel optoelectronic devices. Despite its bulk nature, the BPVE is typically measured with interfaces and metal contacts, raising concerns as to whether the observed signals are genuinely of bulk origin. Here, we use a contactless pump-probe microscopy method to observe the space- and time-resolved dynamics of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal, monodomain $BiFeO_{3}$. We observe asymmetric transport of carriers along the polar axis, confirming the intrinsic bulk and symmetry-driven nature of BPVE. This asymmetric transport persists for several nanoseconds after photoexcitation, which cannot be explained by the shift or phonon ballistic current BPVE mechanisms. Monte Carlo simulations show that asymmetric momentum scattering by defects under non-equilibrium conditions explains the long-lived carrier drift, while first principles calculations confirm that oxygen vacancies have an asymmetric electronic state that can cause such asymmetric scattering. Our findings highlight the critical role of defects in long-lived photoresponses.",

By systematically analyzing the ground-state fidelity, low-lying energy spectra, exciton superfluid and stripe order parameters, and ground-state energy derivatives, we identify a direct and continuous quantum phase transition between two distinct symmetry-breaking phases by tuning the layer separation: an exciton superfluid phase with spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking at small separation, and a unidirectional charge density wave with broken translational symmetry at large separation. Our results highlight quantum Hall bilayers as an ideal platform for realizing and experimentally probing DQCPs under precisely tunable interactions.",

We investigate the electronic friction behavior for the Hubbard-Holstein model using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) theory. We show that electron-electron interactions lead to the formation of two energy levels in the impurity, resulting in two peaks in the electronic friction at the resonances of electron attachment or detachment with the metal's Fermi level. We further benchmark our results against mean field theory (MFT) and exact diagonalization (ED). The results calculated by ED and DMRG show strong agreement at high temperatures, suggesting the results from DMRG are reliable; however, at low temperatures, ED exhibits significant deviations relative to DMRG due to the finite-size limitations inherent in ED calculations. MFT completely fails to recover Fermi resonance in electronic friction. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the electronic friction using EF-LD. Simulations reveal differences between the electronic population and kinetic energy dynamics predicted by MFT and DMRG approaches, suggesting that MFT approach is unreliable for nonadiabatic dynamics of strongly correlated systems.",

    "summary": "In this article, we review some recent theoretical developments on potential high-temperature superconductors and unconventional metallic states that can arise from doping a spin-one Mott insulator in the $d^{8}$ valence. These studies are particularly relevant-though not limited-to the recently discovered bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We focus on a ferromagnetic (FM) Kondo lattice model with mobile electrons in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital coupled to the localized spin moments in $d_{z^2}$ orbital through a large Hund's coupling $J_H$. In the large $J_H$ limit, the model reduces to the type II t-J model with a mixture of spin-half singlon states and spin-one doublon states. We summarize DMRG results on the Luther-Emery liquid in one dimensional chain and two-leg ladder. Then we mainly focus on bilayer square lattice and show that a large inter-layer coupling $J_\\perp$ of $d_{z^2}$ orbital can induce strong inter-layer pairing of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong $J_\\perp$ limit, a kinetic-energy driven high $T_c$ superconductivity is demonstrated in an ideal model with only a single hopping term. Furthermore, the model predicts a symmetric pseudogap metal-dubbed `second Fermi liquid\"-in the underdoped regime, yielding a phase diagram analogous to that of hole-doped cuprates. The bilayer Kondo model therefore, presents a promising platform for both realizing higher-Tc superconductors and exploring non-Fermi liquid physics. We also comment on the possible limitations of the current models for the bilayer nickelate material and point out some future directions.",

    "summary": "Thermoelectric materials can generate clean energy by transforming waste heat into electricity. The effectiveness of thermoelectric materials is measured by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT. The quest for high ZT materials has drawn extensive research experimentally and theoretically. However, due to the vast material space, finding high ZT materials is time-consuming and costly. To improve the efficiency of discovering new thermoelectric materials, recent studies have employed machine learning with databases to search for high ZT candidates. In this work, we examine the effects of adding various physical concepts on the performance of machine learning models in predicting TE properties. The objective is to improve the model ability to capture the underlying physics in designing TE materials. These concepts include short range order and crystal structure class. Results show some improvements in accuracy. However, the current models do not distinguish between dilute alloys and concentrated alloys, rendering them inadequate in predicting doping effects. To better capture the electronic band structure effect from doping, we included various dopant properties as features. This increases the prediction accuracy in doped materials. Furthermore, we used a genetic algorithm to rank features for various thermoelectric properties to provide physical insight into key parameters in designing thermoelectric materials.",

    "summary": "Open quantum systems (OQS's) are ubiquitous in non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and in quantum science and technology. Solving the dynamics of an OQS in a quantum many-body bath has been considered a computationally hard problem because of the dimensionality curse. Here, considering that full knowledge of the bath dynamics is unnecessary for describing the reduced dynamics of an OQS, we prove a polynomial complexity theorem, that is, the number of independent equations required to fully describe the dynamics of an OQS increases at most linearly with the evolution time and polynomially with the bath size. Therefore, efficient computational algorithms exist for solving the dynamics of a small-sized OQS (such as a qubit or an atom). We further prove that, when the dynamics of an OQS and the bath is represented by a tensor network, a tensor contraction procedure can be specified such that the bond dimension (i.e., the range of tensor indices contracted in each step) increases only linearly (rather than exponentially) with the evolution time, providing explicitly efficient algorithms for a wide range of OQS's. We demonstrate the theorems and the tensor-network algorithm by solving two widely encountered OQS problems, namely, a spin in a Gaussian bath (the spin-boson model) and a central spin coupled to many environmental spins (the Gaudin model). This work provides approaches to understanding dynamics of OQS's, learning the environments via quantum sensors, and optimizing quantum information processing in noisy environments.",

The dynamic current-current correlation function is obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit, and the optical conductivity is extracted using numerical analytic continuation. To achieve this, we develop a multiscale approach: the non-perturbative low-frequency behavior is computed using the unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique, while the high-frequency physics is captured via a self-consistent (semi-)analytic diagrammatic theory. We found that across a broad temperature range where the DC resistivity displays anomalous scaling, $\\sim T^\\alpha$ with $0<\\alpha\\lesssim 1$, the Nernst-Einstein relation implies the diffusion constant with the characteristic $\\sim 1/\\sqrt{T}$ \"strange metal\" behavior. It was also revealed that the insulating regime is entered through a peculiar non-Fermi liquid state-which we call a Pseudogap Metal-characterized by insulating charge compressibility coexisting with metallic transport. Diagrammatically, the high-temperature incoherent transport is captured by the dressed polarization bubble, whereas near the metal-insulator crossover, the effective interaction vertex between opposite-spin particles is responsible for transferring the Drude weight to a high-frequency continuum.",

    "summary": "Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ short-ranged $\\textit{Ans\\\"atze}$, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a novel semi-Dirac spin liquid, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for future neutron-scattering studies on these materials.",

    "summary": "Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \\mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.",

However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their effectiveness and limitations.",

    "summary": "The rapid development of universal machine learning potentials (uMLPs) has enabled efficient, accurate predictions of diverse material properties across broad chemical spaces. While their capability for modeling phonon properties is emerging, systematic benchmarking across chemically diverse systems remains limited. We evaluate six recent uMLPs (EquiformerV2, MatterSim, MACE, and CHGNet) on 2,429 crystalline materials from the Open Quantum Materials Database. Models were used to compute atomic forces in displaced supercells, derive interatomic force constants (IFCs), and predict phonon properties including lattice thermal conductivity (LTC), compared with density functional theory (DFT) and experimental data. The EquiformerV2 pretrained model trained on the OMat24 dataset exhibits strong performance in predicting atomic forces and third-order IFC, while its fine-tuned counterpart consistently outperforms other models in predicting second-order IFC, LTC, and other phonon properties. Although MACE and CHGNet demonstrated comparable force prediction accuracy to EquiformerV2, notable discrepancies in IFC fitting led to poor LTC predictions. Conversely, MatterSim, despite lower force accuracy, achieved intermediate IFC predictions, suggesting error cancellation and complex relationships between force accuracy and phonon predictions. This benchmark guides the evaluation and selection of uMLPs for high-throughput screening of materials with targeted thermal transport properties.",

    "summary": "Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure, which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4. Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity.",

    "summary": "Mott quantum criticality is a central theme in correlated electron physics, observed in systems featuring both continuous zero-temperature transitions and those with finite-temperature critical endpoints. Within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), the paradigmatic single-band Hubbard model (SBHM) displays such criticality only above a finite-temperature endpoint. In contrast, the modified periodic Anderson model (MPAM) is a rare example known to host a surface of genuinely continuous Mott quantum critical points (QCPs) at zero temperature. Using DMFT with the numerical renormalization group as an impurity solver, we investigate the finite-temperature, real-frequency properties of the MPAM. Our central finding is the emergence of quantum critical scaling in the electrical resistivity, with critical exponents $z_{\\text{met}} = 0.76$ and $z_{\\text{ins}} = 0.66$ on the metallic and insulating sides, respectively. These values fall within the range reported for the SBHM, suggesting that both transitions are governed by a common universality class. We further substantiate the presence of local quantum criticality by demonstrating robust $\\omega/T$ scaling in single- and two-particle correlation functions. Finally, we identify novel transport signatures in the optical conductivity, where the distinct evolution of two isosbestic points serves as a unique fingerprint of the QCP. These results establish the MPAM as a canonical model for investigating genuine Mott quantum criticality and support the existence of a universal framework for this fundamental phenomenon.",

    "summary": "The two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field, i.e., the quantum Hall system, is remarkably rich. At half filling of the lowest Landau level, it has been predicted that ``composite fermions'' -- emergent quasiparticle of an electron with two magnetic flux quanta -- can experience zero net magnetic field and form a Fermi sea, dubbed composite Fermi liquid (CFL). However, the seemingly simple appearance of CFL is a strongly correlated quantum many-body state in disguise, and to solve it in a controlled manner is extremely difficult, to the level that the thermodynamic properties of CFL is still largely unknown. In this work, we perform state-of-the-art thermal tensor network simulations on the $\\nu=1/2$ Landau level systems, and observe low-temperature power-law behaviour of the specific heat, signaling the gapless nature of CFL. More importantly, the power is extracted to be closed to $2/3$, clearly deviated from the ordinary linear-$T$ Fermi liquid behaviour, suggesting the coupling between the CFs and the dynamical emergent gauge field and therefore revealed the quantum many-body aspect of the CFL state. Relevance of our methodology to other quantum Hall settings and moir\\'e systems is discussed.",

Still, understanding the atomistic details of Co$_3$O$_4$-water interfaces under operando conditions remains extremely challenging. While ab initio molecular dynamics have become an essential tool for investigating these dynamic interfaces in silico, they are limited to only a few picoseconds and a few hundred atoms. In this work, we overcome these limitations by training a high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) on density functional theory data, which allows us to significantly extend the accessible time and length scales. Employing this HDNNP, we perform simulations to unravel the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of Co$_3$O$_4$(001)-water interfaces in detail. Our simulations reveal distinct characteristics of the two possible A and B terminations. The B-terminated surface stabilizes a compact, quasi-epitaxial hydration layer with strong templating effects, enhanced hydroxylation, and a well-organized hydrogen-bond network. In contrast, the A-termination forms a more diffuse contact layer with weaker templating, lower hydroxylation, and less ordered interfacial water. Extended simulations further uncover proton transfer pathways, including intermittent protonation of surface hydroxyls, migration of water molecules into the epitaxial layer, and rare hydronium-like configurations.",

    "summary": "Partial chemical substitution inevitably introduces disorder. In doped Hund's metals, such as the iron-based superconductors, effects like charge doping and chemical pressure are often considered dominant. Here, we investigate spin excitations in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$)$_2$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) by high-resolution Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) for samples with $x = 0, 0.035,$ and $ 0.085$. In CrBFA, Cr acts as a hole dopant, but also introduces localized spins that compete with Fe-derived magnetic excitations. We found that the Fe-derived magnetic excitations are softened primarily by damping, becoming overdamped for $x = 0.085$. At this doping level, complementary angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) show the absence of electronic structure reconstruction effects such as the nematic band splitting. We propose a localized spin model that explicitly incorporates substitutional disorder and Cr local moments, successfully reproducing our key observations. These results reveal a case where disorder dominates over charge doping in the case of a correlated Hund's metal.",

While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.",

Particular emphasis is placed on twisted mass fermions, whose properties in this context have not been systematically explored before. We confirm the expected O(a) improvement in the free theory and observe that this improvement persists in the interacting case. By leveraging an electric-field-based method for mass renormalization, we reliably tune to maximal twist and establish the method's applicability in the two-flavor model. Once mass renormalization is included, the pion mass exhibits rapid convergence to the continuum limit. Finite-volume effects are addressed using two complementary approaches: dispersion relation fits and finite-volume scaling. Our results show excellent agreement with semiclassical predictions and reveal a milder volume dependence for twisted mass fermions compared to staggered and Wilson discretizations. In addition, we observe clear isospin-breaking effects, suggesting intriguing parallels with lattice QCD. These findings highlight the advantages of twisted mass fermions for Hamiltonian simulations and motivate their further exploration, particularly in view of future applications to higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories.",

    "summary": "The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function, the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.",

In parallel, AFM simulations using the particle probe model provide a cost-effective approach for rapid AFM image generation. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models and substantial simulated datasets, properties such as molecular structure, electrostatic potential, and molecular graph can be predicted from AFM images. However, transferring model performance from simulated to experimental AFM images poses challenges due to the subtle variations in real experimental data compared to the seemingly flawless simulations. In this study, we explore style translation to augment simulated images and improve the predictive performance of machine learning models in surface property analysis. We reduce the style gap between simulated and experimental AFM images and demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing structure discovery models through local structural property distribution comparisons. This research presents a novel approach to improving the efficiency of machine learning models in the absence of labelled experimental data.",

To better understand the many-body normal state from which superconductivity arises, it is important to ascertain the nature and role of correlations in its electronic structure. To provide insights into this question, we use a fully charge self-consistent DFT+e-DMFT (eDMFT) approach to study La327 at several compressive strain levels. At the strain level where superconductivity has been observed experimentally (-2\\%), in contrast with DFT and DFT+$U$ results, the so-called $\\gamma$ pocket emerges and the associated band, of mostly $d_{z^2}$ character, crosses the Fermi level exhibiting `flat band''-like features when dynamical correlations are included. Larger strain levels suppress the $\\gamma$ pocket, which may have implications for superconductivity or its pairing symmetry.",

This model includes both $V_7$ and $V_8$, which are hybridizations between localized $4f$- and conduction electrons in $\\Gamma_7$ and $\\Gamma_8$ orbitals, respectively. For the case of $V_7=V_8$ with the local $\\Gamma_5$ triplet ground state, we have reported the discovery of a three-channel Kondo (TCK) phase, characterized by a residual entropy of $\\log \\phi$ with the golden ratio $\\phi=(1+\\sqrt{5})/2$. In this research, by depicting the ground-state phase diagram on the $(V_8, V_7)$ plane, we attempt to unveil the effect of $V_7$ and $V_8$ on the emergence of the TCK phase. After performing a lot of numerical calculations, we find that the TCK phase appears in a relatively wide region on the $(V_8, V_7)$ plane. The boundary curves surrounding the TCK phase are determined by the variation of the temperature dependence in entropy and the abrupt change in energy spectra. We consider that most of the phases surrounding the TCK phase are Fermi liquids, but the non-Fermi liquid two-channel Kondo phase is unexpectedly found to exist next to the TCK phase. Finally, we briefly comment on the actual material concerning the detection of the TCK phase.",

We also calculate the topological number using the holographic Green's function and find that the Chern number is independent of the tilting parameter.

We analyze the algorithm for the Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling as well as at finite doping. The method relies on global quench dynamics and short imaginary time evolution, the latter being realized by architecture-tailored pulse sequences starting from a product state of plaquettes. Our numerical results show that complex Loschmidt echoes can be efficiently obtained for large many-body states over a broad spectral range.

However, accurate phonon calculations in defect systems are often hindered by the high computational cost of large-supercell first-principles calculations. Recently, foundation models, such as universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), emerge as a promising alternative for rapid phonon calculations, but the quantitatively low accuracy restricts its fundamental applicability for high-level defect phonon calculations, such as nonradiative carrier capture rates. In this paper, we propose a \"one defect, one potential\" strategy in which an MLIP is trained on a limited set of perturbed supercells. We demonstrate that this strategy yields phonons with accuracy comparable to density functional theory (DFT), regardless of the supercell size. The predicted accuracy of defect phonons is validated by phonon frequencies, Huang-Rhys factors, and phonon dispersions. Further calculations of photoluminescence (PL) spectra and nonradiative capture rates based on this defect-specific model also show good agreements with DFT results, meanwhile reducing the computational expenses by more than an order of magnitude. Our approach provides a practical pathway for studying defect phonons in 10$^4$-atom large supercell with high accuracy and efficiency.",

Here we discover its conceptual counterpart, i.e., a symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order transition. It emerges from a one-dimensional realization of deconfined criticality between charge- and bond-ordered states driven by competing Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon couplings, for which quantum fluctuations and thereby the nature of the transition can be tuned systematically via the phonon frequency $\\omega_0$. In the classical limit $\\omega_0 \\to 0$, a low-energy Dirac theory predicts a direct first-order transition with emergent U(1) symmetry. Using exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide strong evidence for symmetry enhancement and even finite-size scaling on intermediate length scales but in the thermodynamic limit it turns into a narrow intermediate phase where both order parameters are finite, as chiral U(1) symmetry is weakly broken on the lattice. Including quantum lattice fluctuations diminishes the width of the intermediate phase, gradually restores the U(1) symmetry, and eventually tunes the system to a deconfined quantum critical point.",

    "summary": "Strongly interacting fermions represent the key constituent of several intriguing phases of matter. However, due to the inherent complexity of these systems, important regimes are still inaccessible. Here, we derive a realistic and flexible setup based on ultracold magnetic lanthanide atoms trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Leveraging their large magnetic moments, we design a fermionic $t-J$ model with independently tunable hopping, spin-spin couplings, and onsite interaction. Through combined analytical and numerical analysis, we uncover a variety of many-body quantum phases$-$including superconducting and topological states. Crucially, in the regime of attractive onsite interaction we reveal that topology and superconductivity coexist, thus giving rise to an exotic state of matter: a topological triplet superconductor. We also outline a practical protocol to prepare and detect all discovered phases using current experimental techniques. Our results establish an alternative and powerful route for a deeper understanding of strongly interacting fermionic quantum matter.",

In the ordered phase, the spectrum contains a ladder of bound states and intertwined scattering resonances, which enable various scattering channels. By preparing wave packets on a $24 \\times 24$ lattice and evolving the state with tensor networks, we explore and characterize these regimes, ranging from elastic scattering in the perturbative regime, to non-perturbative processes closer to the critical point. Then, we break the spin inversion symmetry and study the stability of the metastable false vacuum state on the collision of its excitations. We find that a highly-energetic scattering process can induce a violent decay of the false vacuum, and investigate the spread of the resulting true vacuum bubble.",

We demonstrate that this problem can be overcome by relaxing the requirements on the underlying algebraic structure, and show that general matrix product operator symmetries are described by a pre-bialgebra. As a guiding example, we focus on the anomalous $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry of the XX model, which manifests the mixed anomaly between its $U(1)$ momentum and winding symmetry. We show how this anomaly is embedded into the non-semisimple corepresentation category, providing a novel mechanism for realizing such anomalous symmetries on the lattice. Additionally, the representation category which describes the renormalization properties is semisimple and semi-monoidal, which provides a new class of mixed state renormalization fixed points. Finally, we show that up to a quantum channel, this anomalous $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry is equivalent to a more conventional MPO symmetry obtained on the boundary of a double semion model. In this way, our work provides a bridge between well-understood topological defect symmetries and those that arise in more realistic models.",

Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.",

Viewed mainly as a source of performance degradation, recent theoretical insights reveal that local disorder profoundly influences the electronic structure and phonon dynamics, without inducing deep electronic traps or non-radiative recombination pathways. In this work, we highlight advances in modeling local disorder using polymorphous and anharmonic frameworks, showing how these methods explain experimental observations and predict new trends. We emphasize the role of disorder in the breakdown of the phonon quasiparticle picture and in modulating electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions, particularly in soft, anharmonic phases of matter, with significant effects on electrical and thermal transport. We outline opportunities for integrating these insights into predictive modeling for energy materials and propose combining advanced first-principles methods with machine learning.",

Here, we present a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory. In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors.

However, the quantum phase diagrams, particularly near the dominant antiferromagnetic Kitaev regime, remain puzzling despite extensive studies. In this work, we perform unbiased exact diagonalization calculations of the Kitaev-$\\Gamma$ model in a [111] magnetic field on a $C_{6}$-symmetric 24-site cluster. By calculating the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological entanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify signatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field regime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative $\\Gamma$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid featured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate magnetic field. Our findings provide insight into the field-induced intermediate phases in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model and pave the way for the hunt for emergent phases in real materials.",

    "summary": "This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based (MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.",

    "summary": "Since the long range entanglement is a universal characteristic of topological quantum states belonging to the same class, a suitable mathematical representation of the long range entanglement has to be also universal. In this Letter, we introduce such a representation for the family of Toric Code states by using Kitaev's Ladders as building blocks. We consider Toric Code states corresponding to various planar graphs and apply non-local dientanglers to qubits corresponding to non-contractible cycles that satisfy a topological constraint. We demonstrate that, independent of the geometry of the underlying graph, disentanglers convert Toric Code states into a tensor product of Kitaev's Ladder states. Since Kitaev's Ladders with arbitrary geometric configurations include the short-range entanglements, we conclude that the above universal and non-local pattern of entanglement between ladders is responsible of the long-range entanglement inherent in Toric Code states. Our result emphasizes in the capability of such non-local representations to describe topological order in ground-state wave functions of topological quantum systems.",

    "summary": "Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a mainstay in computationally-guided materials science, surpassing traditional force fields due to their flexible functional form and superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties of materials. This flexibility is achieved through mathematically-rigorous basis sets that describe interatomic interactions within a local atomic environment. The number of parameters in these basis sets influences both the size of the training dataset required and the computational speed of the MLIP. Consequently, compressing MLIPs by reducing the number of parameters is a promising route to more efficient simulations. In this work, we use low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations under fixed-rank constraints to achieve this compression. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm with automatic rank augmentation helps to find a deeper local minimum of the fitted potential. The methodology is verified using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) model and benchmarked on multi-component systems: a Mo-Nb-Ta-W medium-entropy alloy, molten LiF-NaF-KF, and a glycine molecular crystal. The proposed approach achieves up to 50% compression without any loss of MTP accuracy and can be applied to compress other MLIPs.",

    "summary": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a vector-based random \\underline{\\textbf{Te}}nsor network for high-\\underline{\\textbf{R}}ank \\underline{\\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Beyond previous BCS mean-field descriptions, our theory can precisely treat the pairing and Coulomb interactions over an unprecedentedly broad range of parameters by using the numerical renormalization group method. On increasing the ratio of pairing to Coulomb interactions, the low-energy physics of the system evolves from the spin Kondo to mixed valence regimes and eventually reaches an anisotropic charge Kondo phase, while a crossover from $1e$- to $2e$-periodic Coulomb blockade of transport is revealed at high temperatures. For weak pairing, the superconducting condensate is frozen in the local spin-flip processes but fluctuates in the virtual excitations, yielding an enhanced spin Kondo temperature. For strong pairing, massive fluctuations of Cooper pairs are crucial for establishing charge Kondo correlations whose Kondo temperature rapidly decreases with the pairing interaction. Surprisingly, a charge-exchange induced local field may occur even at the charge degenerate point, thereby destroying the charge Kondo effect. These are demonstrated in the spectral and transport properties of the island.",

    "summary": "Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density $w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed Digital Hydrogen Platform (\\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery of materials in complex chemical spaces.",

Both regular and random dilution patterns are considered. In systems with regular dilution, tuning the interlayer interaction drives a quantum phase transition from a N\\'eel-ordered phase to a quantum disordered phase, consistent with the $O(3)$ universality class. In contrast, random dilution gives rise to a two-step transition: from the N\\'eel phase to an intermediate Mott glass (MG) phase, followed by a transition to the quantum disordered phase. Within the MG phase, the uniform magnetic susceptibility exhibits a stretched-exponential temperature dependence $\\chi_u \\sim \\exp(-b/T^\\alpha)$, $0 < \\alpha < 1$. At the N\\'eel-to-glass transition, quenched disorder modifies the critical exponents in a manner consistent with the Harris criterion. These findings provide new insights into disorder-driven quantum phase transitions and the emergence of glassy phases in diluted bilayer quantum magnets.",

The challenge is in characterizing the energy states of these large singlet fission molecular aggregates that participate in the process. Large dimensionality and essential multi-configuration nature of the electronic states of interest combine to make accurate ab initio calculations prohibitively difficult. We present a spin-resolved tight-binding excitonic model for singlet fission that can be parameterized based on ab initio calculations on monomers and dimers of molecules, and is highly suitable for the study of aggregates using tensor network methods such as the density matrix renormalization group. This tensor network coarse-grained model is demonstrated specifically on the pentacene crystal, where we evaluate the spectra and density of states. We show the natural emergence of bands of states in some cases, and characterize them. Through an analysis of entanglement entropy of the eigenstates, we gain crucial insight into the extent of their multireference character. This method is useful in understanding not just the structure of these extended aggregates, but also being the cornerstone for incorporation of vibronic features and simulation of the singlet fission dynamics.",

    "summary": "Motivated by recent experimental observations of possible spin supersolid states in triangular lattice compounds, we study the dynamical properties of various ground states in the spin-1/2 easy-axis antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with impurities under magnetic fields, using numerical Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods. For both spin supersolid states in the low and high fields, the gapless Goldstone mode at the $K$ points remains robust with impurities, which is related to the presence of spin superfluidity. As a comparison, we find a splitting of magnon band at the same impurity density level in the conventional magnetic state, the so-called up-up-down state. In addition, the finite superfluid stiffness probed by the twisted phase in the spin supersolid states is consistent with the excitation spectrum. We argue that this excitation spectrum with impurity provides direct evidence of the dissipationless dynamics in the spin supersolid states, which could be tested in neutron scattering experiments.",

    "summary": "Dislocations control the mechanical behavior of crystalline materials, yet their quantitative characterization in bulk has remained elusive. Transmission Electron Microscopy provides atomic-scale resolution but is restricted to thin foils, limiting relevance to structural performance. Dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) has recently opened access to three-dimensional, non-destructive imaging of dislocations in macroscopic crystals. A critical bottleneck, however, is the reliable identification of weak- versus strong-beam conditions. Weak-beam imaging enhances dislocation contrast, while strong-beam conditions are dominated by multiple scattering and obscure interpretation. Current practice depends on manual classification by specialists, which is subjective, slow, and incompatible with the scale of modern experiments. Here, we introduce a deep learning framework that automates this task using a lightweight convolutional neural network trained on small, hand-labeled datasets. By enabling robust, rapid, and scalable identification of imaging conditions, this approach transforms DFXM into a high-throughput tool, unlocking statistically significant studies of dislocation dynamics in bulk materials.",

Our method explicitly uses the lattice's native C3v symmetry at each site, generalizing QR-based acceleration (previously limited to square lattices) to enable efficient and stable contractions. This approach achieves order-of-magnitude speedups over conventional singular value decomposition (SVD)-based CTMRG while maintaining high numerical precision. Comprehensive benchmark calculations for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg and Kitaev models demonstrate higher computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. We further employ our method to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, where we provide numerical evidence for the universal 1/r^4 decay of the dimer-dimer correlation function within the quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. Our work establishes a framework for extending QR-based CTMRG to other lattice geometries, opening new avenues for studying exotic quantum phases with tensor networks.",

    "summary": "The combinations of machine learning with ab initio methods have attracted much attention for their potential to resolve the accuracy-efficiency dilemma and facilitate calculations for large-scale systems. Recently, equivariant message passing neural networks (MPNNs) that explicitly incorporate symmetry constraints have demonstrated promise for interatomic potential and density functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian predictions. However, the high-order tensors used to represent node and edge information are coupled through the Clebsch-Gordan tensor product (CGTP), leading to steep increases in computational complexity and seriously hindering the performance of equivariant MPNNs. Here, we develop High-order Tensor machine-learning Hamiltonian (Hot-Ham), an E(3) equivariant MPNN framework that combines two advanced technologies local coordinate transformation and Gaunt tensor product (GTP) to efficiently model DFT Hamiltonians. These two innovations significantly reduce the complexity of tensor products from O(L^6) to O(L^3) or O(L^2 log^2 L) for the max tensor order L, and enhance the performance of MPNNs. Benchmarks on several public datasets demonstrate its state-of-the-art accuracy with relatively few parameters, and the applications to multilayer twisted moir\\'e systems, heterostructures and allotropes showcase its generalization ability and high efficiency. Our Hot-Ham method provides a new perspective for developing efficient equivariant neural networks and would be a promising approach for investigating the electronic properties of large-scale materials systems.",

Our approach combines the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to, state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.",

In this work, we carry out a detailed investigation using non-degenerate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe reflection spectroscopy to probe the ultrafast dynamics of SOEE and their coupling to spin fluctuations in NiPS3. Transient reflectivity data reveals acoustic phonon oscillations at ~ 27 GHz, along with two distinct relaxation timescales: fast (1-9 ps) and slower components (1-4 ns) associated with SOEE coherence and spin reordering, respectively. Both timescales exhibit pronouns temperature dependence near the exciton dissociation (TED = 120 K) and Neel TN = 155 K) temperatures. The SOEE coherence shortens from ~ 8-9 ps at T < TED to ~ 3 ps at T > TED with a finite tail persisting beyond TN. The spin reordering time grows near 120 K, and shows critical slowing down around TN. Pump fluence studies further corroborate their spin origin. Our findings uncover the direct interplay between the excitonic and spin degrees of freedom across ultrafast and longer timescales, offering new opportunities to probe and engineer emergent many-body interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.",

    "summary": "We conducted x-ray absorption (XAS) and magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Co $L_{2,3}$ edges on single crystals of the Kitaev candidate honeycomb lattice compound BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. The measurements employed the inverse partial fluorescence yield technique, which is ideal for acquiring reliable x-ray absorption spectra from highly insulating samples, enabling precise quantitative analysis. Our experimental results revealed a significant linear dichroic signal, indicating strong trigonal distortion in the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. We performed a detailed analysis of the experimental XAS and XMCD spectra using a full-multiplet configuration-interaction cluster model. This analysis unveiled that the $t_{2g}$ hole density is predominantly localized in the $a_{1g}$ orbital. Through XMCD sum rules and theoretical calculations, we quantified both the spin and orbital magnetic moments. Our study demonstrates that the local electronic structure of the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra displays an effective trigonal distortion of approximately $-0.114$ eV. This distortion is larger than the Co $3d$ spin-orbit coupling constant, emphasizing the crucial impact of local structural distortions on the electronic and magnetic properties of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.",

    "summary": "Amorphous interfacial complexions have been shown to restrict grain growth and improve damage tolerance in nanocrystalline alloys, with increased chemical complexity stabilizing the complexions themselves. Here, we investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand how dopants self-organize within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the amorphous complexions themselves.",

    "summary": "The reliable identification of magnetic ground states remains a major challenge in high-throughput materials databases, where density functional theory (DFT) workflows often converge to ferromagnetic (FM) solutions. Here, we partially address this challenge by developing machine learning classifiers trained on experimentally validated MAGNDATA magnetic materials leveraging a limited number of simple compositional, structural, and electronic descriptors sourced from the Materials Project database. Our propagation vector classifiers achieve accuracies above 92%, outperforming recent studies in reliably distinguishing zero from nonzero propagation vector structures, and exposing a systematic ferromagnetic bias inherent to the Materials Project database for more than 7,843 materials. In parallel, LightGBM and XGBoost models trained directly on the Materials Project labels achieve accuracies of 84-86% (with macro F1 average scores of 63-66%), which proves useful for large-scale screening for magnetic classes, if refined by MAGNDATA-trained classifiers. These results underscore the role of machine learning techniques as corrective and exploratory tools, enabling more trustworthy databases and accelerating progress toward the identification of materials with various properties.",

This condition is surprisingly well satisfied by groundstates of quantum critical lattice models even at small system sizes. We perform a search in the space of states of very small systems (four qubits and four qutrits) and examine the states that satisfy this condition. By reconstructing a local Hamiltonian from each state, we are able to identify many of these solutions with known CFTs; others are gapped fixed points, or involve large relevant perturbations, and others are CFTs we have not yet identified. These ideas are also useful for identifying continuous quantum phase transitions in a given family of Hamiltonians, and for identifying the nature of the critical theory in small systems.",

The trained network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions, showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.",

Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions.

    "summary": "Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.",

    "summary": "To evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in systems with competing interactions, we developed a self-learning quantum Monte Carlo (SLQMC) method to simulate the phase transition in the classical Holstein-spin-fermion model. In SLQMC, machine learning techniques are employed to approximate the free energy, thereby bypassing the need for exact diagonalization and significantly reducing computational cost. We assess the performance of SLQMC using both linear regression and neural network models. Our results show that both models are capable of capturing the phase transition from the antiferromagnetic state to the charge-density-wave state. However, the sampling efficiency decreases near the AFM-CDW phase transition, which is attributed to the increased mean-squared-error of the machine learning model. Additionally, the sampling efficiency decreases with increasing lattice size. This suppression is due to the increased root-mean-squared-error as the machine learning model is applied to a large lattice and the finite-size effect, wherein the energy gap between the ground state and low-energy excited states decreases as the lattice grows. Our findings highlight the necessity of highly accurate machine learning models to simulate theoretical models with complex, competing microscopic interactions on a large lattice.",

GPUTB employs atomic environment descriptors, enabling the model parameters to incorporate environmental dependence. This allows the model to transfer to different basis, xc-functionals, and allotropes easily. Combined with the linear scaling quantum transport method, we have calculated the electronic density of states for up to 100 million atoms in pristine graphene. Trained on finite-temperature structures, the model can be easily extended to millions of atom finite-temperature systems. Furthermore, GPUTB can also successfully describe h-BN/graphene heterojunction systems, demonstrating its capability to handle complex material with high precision. We accurately reproduce the relationship between carrier concentration and room temperature mobility in graphene to verify the framework's accuracy. Therefore, our GPUTB framework presents a delicate balance between computational accuracy and efficiency, providing a powerful computational tool for investing electronic properties for large systems with millions of atoms.",

    "summary": "Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density $w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed Digital Hydrogen Platform (\\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery of materials in complex chemical spaces.",

However, due to the small class of problems which can be solved exactly, there has been substantial interest in quantum simulations of extended Hubbard models to in turn, simulate materials and the interaction-driven phases they host. Here, we study small clusters of molecular anions of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride on NaCl bilayers on Ag(111) using non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy, Electrostatic Force Spectroscopy, and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Spectroscopy, and show that the occupation and transition energies are well described by an extended Hubbard model. In particular, asymmetric clusters of four molecules require the addition of differing inter-site electrostatic interaction terms and on-site potentials, as well as asymmetric hoping terms. With $t<<U$, occupation asymmetry is driven by these terms, independent of U. The good agreement between the model and the data indicate such molecular anion clusters could be used to probe larger systems and a more varied phase space of realistic fermionic Hubbard models.",

Recent measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor (DSF) in cuprate ladder compounds have indicated the presence of a large effective attraction in the single-band Hubbard model, possibly mediated by phonons. Here, we demonstrate that similar DSF features can also be captured by $t$-$J$ descriptions with or even without any attractive term. Motivated by this observation, we systematically investigate the strength and origin of different contributions to the single-band Hamiltonians by downfolding either from the three-band Emery model or the electron-phonon coupled Hubbard-Holstein model. For one-dimensional systems, we find that the extended versions of both single-band descriptions can reproduce the experimentally observed DSF signatures. Finally, we extend our analysis to two dimensions by comparing two-hole correlation functions for the different single-band models. Our results provide new insights into the long-standing question of which single-band Hamiltonian can capture the essential physics of cuprates.",

We demonstrate that the dynamics is integrable for a class of exchange couplings $J(t)$ of the form $\\lambda t + p(t) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\lambda t + p(t))^2 + 4/3}$, where $p(t)$ is an arbitrary periodic function, and construct the corresponding many-body wavefunction.

    "summary": "Proximity effects not only complement the conventional methods of designing materials, but also enable realizing properties that are not present in any constituent region of the considered heterostructure. Here we reveal an unexplored altermagnetic proximity effect (AMPE), distinct from its ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic counterparts. Using first-principles and model analyses of van der Waals heterostructures based on the prototypical altermagnet V$_2$Se$_2$O, we show that its hallmark momentum-alternating spin splitting can be directly imprinted onto adjacent nonmagnetic layers -- a process we term altermagnetization. This is demonstrated in a monolayer PbO through characteristic band splitting and real-space spin densities, with systematic dependence on interlayer spacing and magnetic configuration. We further predict broader AMPE manifestations: Valley-selective spin splitting in a monolayer PbS and a topological superconducting phase in monolayer NbSe$_2$, both inheriting the alternating $k$-space spin texture of the altermagnet. These results establish AMPE not only as a distinct proximity mechanism, but also as a powerful method of using altermagnetism in designing emergent phenomena and versatile applications.",

    "summary": "Designing high-entropy alloys (HEAs) that are both mechanically hard and possess soft magnetic properties is inherently challenging, as a trade-off is needed for mechanical and magnetic properties. In this study, we optimize HEA compositions using a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to achieve simultaneous optimal mechanical and magnetic properties. An ensemble surrogate model is constructed to enhance the accuracy of machine learning surrogate models, while an efficient sampling strategy combining Monte Carlo sampling and acquisition function is applied to explore the high-dimensional compositional space. The implemented MOBO strategy successfully identifies Pareto-optimal compositions with enhanced mechanical and magnetic properties. The ensemble model provides robust and reliable predictions, and the sampling approach reduces the likelihood of entrapment in local optima. Our findings highlight specific elemental combinations that meet the dual design objectives, offering guidance for the synthesis of next-generation HEAs.",

    "summary": "The honeycomb magnet $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ has been a leading candidate for realizing the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL), but its intrinsic spin dynamics have remained obscured by crystal twinning. Here we apply biaxial anisotropic strain to detwin $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ single crystals and directly visualize the intrinsic magnetic excitations using inelastic neutron scattering. We discover that the low-energy spin waves emerge from the $M$ points -- transverse to the magnetic Bragg peaks -- providing direct evidence of anisotropic magnetic interactions in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. The intrinsic spin-wave spectrum imposes stringent constraints on the extended Kitaev Hamiltonian, yielding a refined, quantitatively consistent set of exchange couplings for the zigzag ground state and its low-energy dynamics. Above the magnon band, we uncover broad excitation continua: while a twofold-symmetric feature near 6 meV at $\\Gamma$ is consistent with bimagnon scattering, the dominant spectral weight forms a sixfold-symmetric continuum extending up to $\\sim 16$ meV that cannot be explained by conventional magnons. This strongly supports the presence of fractionalized excitations-a hallmark of Kitaev QSL physics. Our findings establish biaxial strain as a powerful symmetry-breaking probe to access the intrinsic spin dynamics of Kitaev materials and provide critical benchmarks for refining theoretical models of quantum magnetism in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$.",

Here, we address the need for interpretable and generalizable frameworks to understand and predict polymer chemical resistance beyond conventional solubility models. We systematically analyze a large dataset of polymer solvent combinations using a data-driven approach. Our study reveals that polymer crystallinity and density, as well as solvent polarity, are key factors governing chemical resistance, and that these trends are consistent with established theoretical models. These findings provide a foundation for rational screening and design of polymer materials with tailored chemical resistance, advancing both fundamental understanding and practical applications.",

Polarization analysis and incident-photon energy detuning measurements confirm the persistence of collective paramagnon excitations up to $x = 0.50$. Consistent with previous studies on other cuprate families, we observe a pronounced crossover near $x = 0.15$, where paramagnon spectral weight is transferred to incoherent spin-flip excitations associated with the particle-hole continuum. The overall behavior of paramagnons in LCCO resembles that in other hole-doped cuprates and appears insensitive to the persistence of superconductivity at high doping levels in LCCO - up to at least $x = 0.50$, as demonstrated in prior work. These findings support the view that high-energy magnetic excitations probed by RIXS are not a major contributor to superconducting pairing, in line with theories of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity.",

Existing models still exhibit limitations in representing electronic interactions, symmetry, and long-range information. This study compares physics-based site feature calculators with data-driven graph representation strategies. We find that the latter achieve superior performance in representation completeness, convergence speed, and extrapolation capability by incorporating electronic structure generation models-such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) that compress Kohn-Sham wave functions and leveraging multi-task learning. Notably, the CHGNet-V1/V2 strategies, when integrated into the DenseGNN model,significantly outperform state-of-the-art models across 35 datasets from Matbench and JARVIS-DFT, yielding predictions with accuracy close to that of DFT calculations. Furthermore, applying a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy substantially reduces the prediction error for band gaps of complex disordered materials, demonstrating the superiority and potential of data-driven graph representations in accelerating materials discovery.",

A small basis for the excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) -- efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach, whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation, translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for all momenta.",

Using density functional theory combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we compute their Fermi surfaces, transmission coefficients, and orbital-projected density of states. All compounds exhibit nearly half-metallic conductance along the out-of-plane direction. This is characterized by a finite transmission coefficient for one spin channel and a gap in the other, resulting in spin polarization values exceeding 90$\\%$ in the bulk. Notably, Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ displays the ideal half-metallic behavior, with the Fermi energy located deep in the spin-down transmission gap. We further show that this high spin polarization is preserved in bilayer magnetic tunnel junctions, which exhibit a large tunnel magnetoresistance of the order of several hundred percent. This findings underscore the promise of these materials, and in particular of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$, for spintronics applications.",

    "summary": "Spiropyran is a prototype photoswitch that undergoes photoinduced ring-opening via C-O bond fission. The quantum yield for this photochemical reaction is low, with photophysical relaxation being the dominant process. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that photophysical relaxation proceeds via cleavage and subsequent reformation of a C-N bond. However, experimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking; most time-resolved studies have probed in the ultraviolet-visible domain, where C-N bond fission is unlikely to leave clear signatures. Here, we use non-adiabatic dynamics simulations in conjunction with X-ray absorption spectroscopic calculations to investigate the possibility of tracking the photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the nitrogen K-edge. The simulations predict that cleavage of the C-N bond results in a transient red-shift of the X-ray absorption. These results indicate a potential experimental route to gain a mechanistic understanding of the efficient photophysical relaxation that limits the efficiency of spiropyran-based photochromic systems.",

Despite significant advances in experimental techniques, developing a comprehensive and rigorous theoretical framework for modeling and interpreting the transient response in photoexcited materials remains a challenge. Here, we present a first-principles approach to simulating pump-probe spectroscopy and disentangling the electronic and thermal contributions underlying exciton dynamics. We showcase our method to three materials, representative for different classes of solids: the transition-metal dichalcogenides WSe$_2$, the halide perovskite CsPbBr$_3$, and the transition-metal oxide TiO$_2$, showing remarkable agreement with experimental counterparts. We find that (i) photoinduced Coulomb screening is the primary electronic effect, responsible for a blue shift of exciton resonances, while (ii) Pauli blocking plays a minor role, and (iii) thermal lattice expansion leads to a red shift of the spectra. We further demonstrate how key parameters such as excitation density, pump photon energy, and pump polarization modulate the transient absorption spectra, offering direct control over the exciton-resonance energy. Our approach establishes a quantitative and predictive framework for interpreting pump-probe experiments, providing actionable insights for the design of energy-selective optoelectronic devices through exciton engineering.",

It is based on an entirely integro-differential formulation of time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory, the noncrossing approximation, and the quantum representation of a driving electromagnetic field. For heavy-fermion systems, we identify two key nonequilibrium mechanisms governing their time evolution after a single-cycle terahertz excitation: transient, instantaneous shift from the Kondo toward the mixed-valence regime by an enhanced, photoassisted hybridization, and slow recovery of the heavy-fermion state due to the long Kondo coherence time. This explains recent time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy experiments microscopically and establishes the latter as a technique for direct experimental access to the Kondo coherence time and to the heavy-fermion quasiparticle weight, central for the classification of heavy-fermion quantum phase transitions.",

    "summary": "We compute the electron spin susceptibility in the pseudogap regime of the two-dimensional Hubbard model in the framework of a SU(2) gauge theory of fluctuating magnetic order. The electrons are fractionalized in fermionic chargons with a pseudospin degree of freedom and bosonic spinons. The chargons are treated in a renormalized mean-field theory and order in a N\\'eel or spiral magnetic state in a broad range around half-filling below a transition temperature $T^*$. Fluctuations of the spin orientation are captured by the spinons. Their dynamics is governed by a non-linear sigma model, with spin stiffnesses computed microscopically from the pseudospin susceptibility of the chargons. The SU(2) gauge group is higgsed in the chargon sector, and the spinon fluctuations prevent breaking of the physical spin symmetry at any finite temperature. The electron spin susceptibility obtained from the gauge theory shares many features with experimental observations in the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors: the dynamical spin susceptibility $S(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$ has a spin gap, the static uniform spin susceptibility $\\kappa_s$ decreases strongly with temperature below $T^*$, and the NMR relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ vanishes exponentially in the low temperature limit if the ground state is quantum disordered. At low hole doping, $S(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$ exhibits nematicity below a transition temperature $T_{\\rm nem} < T^*$, and at larger hole doping in the entire pseudogap regime below $T^*$.",

    "summary": "Motivated by possible spintronics applications in antiferromagnets, it was recently observed that symmetry admits magnets that combine attractive features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These systems, dubbed altermagnets, have been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from ARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of magnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in MnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of the splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of neutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to measure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct characterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In this article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal antiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material is, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in this material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar coupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the dipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased sample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross section that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature that clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights the potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through its exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum.",

    "summary": "The La2CoMnO6 (LCMO) perovskite has received a lot of attention due to its near room temperature magnetodielectric effect. Despite the recent efforts, the mechanism ruling the correlation between its magnetic and dielectric properties is not yet fully understood. In order to address this issue, we conducted a detailed investigation of the coupling between the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of a polycrystalline LCMO sample. Using magnetic field-dependent x-ray powder diffraction and measurements with a capacitive dilatometer, we show that applying an external magnetic field decreases the unit cell volume, thereby modifying the octahedral distortions. Experiments involving temperature and field-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Co-L2,3 edges provide further evidence that the spin-orbit interaction of outermost Co 3d-orbital and the field-induced enhancement of covalence effects are the key contributors to the magnetostrictive effects. From a detailed analysis using multiplet and density functional theory calculations, we propose that the field-induced modulations of the orbital hybridization and the ligand-to-metal charge transfer are responsible for the changes in the dielectric response of LCMO, thus enabling a direct coupling between magnetic, elastic and dielectric properties in this material.",

    "summary": "Several candidate materials for gapless quantum spin liquids exhibit a vanishing thermal conductivity, which is at odds with theoretical predictions. Here, we show that a suppressed response can arise due to transient localization from fractionalization, even in the absence of extrinsic defects or disorder. Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform magnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and spinons. For moderate magnetic fields, visons are heavy and act as quasi-static disorder that induce transient localization of light spinons even in the translation-invariant model and at zero temperature, which strongly suppresses the residual conductivity at finite but low frequencies. At ultralow frequencies the conductivity is restored; however, such scales can be extremely hard to reach in experiments. Our results identify transient localization as a signature of fractionalization and provide a framework for interpreting anomalous transport in gapless spin liquid candidates.",

This study introduces a quantum-inspired framework leveraging tensor networks (TNs) to optimally map expression data into a lower dimensional representation preserving biological locality. Using Quantum Mutual Information (QMI), a nonparametric measure natural for tensor networks, we quantify gene dependencies and establish statistical significance via permutation testing. This constructs robust interaction networks where the edges reflect biologically meaningful relationships that are resilient to random chance. The approach effectively distinguishes true regulatory patterns from experimental noise and biological stochasticity. To test the proposed method, we recover a gene regulatory network consisted of six pathway genes from single-cell RNA sequencing data comprising over $28.000$ lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, we unveil several triadic regulatory mechanisms. By merging quantum physics inspired techniques with computational biology, our method provides novel insights into gene regulation, with applications in disease mechanisms and precision medicine.",

    "summary": "Electronic band structures usually remain unaffected by doping via a chemical-potential shift or by increasing the temperature in conventional band insulators. In contrast, it has been shown that those of Mott and Kondo insulators can change by doping or by increasing the temperature: electronic modes are induced within the band gap, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. Here, by generalizing the underlying mechanism of the remarkable strong-correlation effects, this study shows that various spin and charge perturbations, including magnetization of spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators, can induce electronic modes. The emergent modes can change the band structure, provided that a macroscopic number of spins or charges are excited by the perturbations at a moment. The origins and dispersion relations of the emergent modes are elucidated by investigating the selection rules and using the Bethe ansatz and effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping. The theoretical results are validated by numerical calculations for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models, periodic Anderson models, Kondo lattice models, and ladder and bilayer Hubbard models. This study significantly advances the fundamental understanding of the changes in the band structure driven by spin and charge perturbations and paves the way for band-structure engineering in strong-correlation electronics, utilizing the unconventional characteristics of strongly correlated insulators.",

    "summary": "We investigate the nature of low-energy excitations in a spin chain with antiferrmomagnetic nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and three-site $J_3$ interactions using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group and the single mode approximation techniques. In the absence of the $J_2$ interaction, we identify clear distinctions in the spectral functions in the fully dimerized phase across the exactly dimerized line for different magnitudes of the spins. In contrast to the spin-$1/2$ chain, where the spinon continuum dominates the spectral functions, the magnon modes are prominent in the spectral functions of the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ chains. Through single mode approximation and valence bond solid approaches, we disentangle magnon and spinon contributions to the spectral functions. After including the $J_2$ interactions, for the spin-$1$ chain we trace the evolution of the dynamical structure factor along the phase transition line between the Haldane phase and the fully dimerized phase. We find that the excitation spectrum is a continuum along this line and the spectral gap closes as the order of the transition changes from first order to second order. Along the line of first-order transitions, the spinon-like domain walls are deconfined, and the model exhibits their confinement into discrete bound states away from the transition line. A similar phenomenon occurs in the spin-$3/2$ chain across the phase transition between partially dimerized to fully dimerized phases, revealing a universal spinon confinement phenomenon across first-order phase transitions. This study presents the dynamical structure factor corresponding to the ground state phase diagram and establishes a unified quasiparticle framework for understanding the fundamental nature of excitations across distinct quantum phases in frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg spin chains.",

While the past few years witnessed the development of multiple new universal IPs that cover wide ranges of the periodic table, their applicability to target chemical systems should be carefully investigated. We benchmark several universal IPs using equilibrium zeolite structures as testbeds. We select a diverse set of universal IPs encompassing two major categories: (i) universal analytic IPs, including GFN-FF, UFF, and Dreiding; (ii) pretrained universal machine learning IPs (MLIPs), comprising CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, and EquiformerV2-lE4-lF100-S2EFS-OC22. We compare them with established tailor-made IPs, SLC, ClayFF, and BSFF using experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction as the reference. The tested zeolite structures comprise pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates containing copper species, potassium, and organic cations. We found that GFN-FF is the best among the tested universal analytic IPs, but it does not achieve satisfactory accuracy for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicate systems. All MLIPs can well reproduce experimental or DFT-level geometries and energetics. Among the universal MLIPs, the eSEN-30M-OAM model shows the most consistent performance across all zeolite structures studied. These findings show that the modern pretrained universal MLIPs are practical tools in zeolite screening workflows involving various compositions.",

    "summary": "Extending Hong--Ou--Mandel (HOM) interferometry to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) promises direct access to anyonic statistics, yet remains challenging: on-demand anyon injection is hindered by integer-charged minimal excitations, and recent HOM experiments in the FQHE lack a fully consistent theoretical framework. Here we provide a general theory of time-resolved HOM interferometry in quantum Hall systems. Combining the nonequilibrium bosonized edge theory (NEBET) with the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative theory (UNEPT), we derive exact and perturbative relations obeyed by the relevant cross-correlations of chiral currents valid for spatially extended tunneling operators and generic quadratic edge dynamics. Then, within the Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, we analyze the width of the HOM dip for injected pulses carrying integer and fractional charges. We show that it is governed by the width of the pulses and, for the fractional charge, by a non-trivial power-law behavior of the scaling dimension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting recent experiments on anyonic statistics and electronic interferometry in the quantum Hall regime.",

    "summary": "We address the problem of implementing bottleneck layers from classical pre-trained neural networks on a quantum computer, with the goal of achieving quantum advantage on near-term devices. Our approach begins with a compression step in which the target linear layer is represented as an effective matrix product operator (MPO) without degrading model performance. The MPO is then further disentangled into a more compact form. This enables a hybrid classical-quantum execution scheme, where the disentangling circuits are deployed on a quantum computer while the remainder of the network -- including the disentangled MPO -- runs on classical hardware. We introduce two complementary algorithms for MPO disentangling: (i) an explicitly disentangling variational method leveraging standard tensor-network optimization techniques, and (ii) an implicitly disentangling gradient-descent-based approach. We validate these methods through a proof-of-concept translation of simple classical neural networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10 image classification into a hybrid classical-quantum form.",

    "summary": "The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention. Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising results for long-range time-series forecasting.",

    "summary": "Molten salts are high-temperature ionic liquids whose unique combination of strong Coulombic interactions, large polarizabilities, and high ionic conductivities makes them central to energy storage, metallurgy, and nuclear technology. Understanding their delicate balance of Coulomb forces, short-range repulsion, and electronic polarization, particularly regarding the role that electronic fluctuations play in their structure and dynamics, is critical to predictively designing molten salts for applications of interest. We investigate the importance of electronic fluctuations in molten AgI using density functional theory, a universal machine learning model (Orb), and a classical, empirical pairwise model of interionic interactions. We find that directional polarization fluctuations of iodide ions enhance Ag+ diffusion, manifesting as enhanced force fluctuations and structure in the time-dependent friction experienced by the cations. The coupling between iodide polarization fluctuations and silver diffusion creates a dynamic asymmetry; Ag+ motion is tightly linked to the instantaneous polarization of neighboring I-, whereas I- dynamics are relatively unperturbed by electronic fluctuations. For all structural and dynamic quantities investigated, the Orb model is in excellent agreement with density functional theory-based simulations, highlighting the ability of this universal neural network potential to capture many-body polarization effects. In contrast, the empirical force field fails to reproduce key structural and dynamic quantities involving cations, ultimately because it neglects dynamic electronic fluctuations. Our findings connect liquid=state ionic dynamics with the \"electronic paddle-wheel\" mechanism of ionic diffusion in superionic solids and motivate further exploration of polarization fluctuation effects in complex electrolytes and ionic liquids.",

    "summary": "Anisotropic metal nanostructures exhibit polarization-dependent light scattering. This property has been widely exploited to determine geometries of subwavelength structures using far-field microscopy. Here, we explore the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) to determine the geometries of gold nanorods (NRs) such as in-plane orientation and aspect ratio under linearly polarized dark-field illumination in an optical microscope. We input polarized dark-field scattering spectra and electron microscopy images into a dual-branch multimodal VAE with a single shared latent space trained on paired spectra-image data, using a learnable linear adapter. We achieve prediction of Au NRs using only polarized dark-field scattering spectra input. We determine geometrical parameters of orientational angle and aspect ratio quantitatively via both dual-VAE and physics-based analysis. We show that orientational angle prediction by dual-VAE performs well with only a small (300 particle) training set, yielding a mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.4 and a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.95. This performance is only marginally worse than the physics-based cos(2theta) fitting approach between the scattering intensity and the polarizing angle, which achieves MAE of 8.78 and CCC of 0.99. Aspect ratio determination is also similar for the dual-VAE and physics-based fitting comparison (MAE of 0.21 vs. 0.23 and CCC of 0.53 vs. 0.68). By learning a shared latent manifold linking spectra and morphology, the model can generate NR images with accurate orientation and aspect ratio with spectra-only input in the small-data regime (300 particles), suggesting a general recipe for inverse nano-optical problems requiring both structure and orientation information.",

Despite prediction in the pure Kitaev honeycomb model, realization of QSLs in realistic systems and materials remain scarce.

By establishing a realistic $K$-$J$-$\\Gamma$-$\\Gamma'$ model for Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ -- with a dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev interaction ($K>0$) that quantitatively explains its thermodynamics measurements -- we reveal an intermediate gapless QSL phase under [111] magnetic fields with tensor-network calculations. We confirm the QSL nature of this phase by demonstrating its adiabatic connection to the intensively studied intermediate QSL of the pure AFM Kitaev model under out-of-plane fields. Our results show excellent agreement with recent high-field experiments, thereby explaining the intermediate-field phase in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. These findings bridge the gap between theoretical proposals for a Kitaev-derived QSL and experimental realization, opening new avenues for exploring exotic quantum states of matter in realistic Kitaev materials.",

In this paper, we offer a consistent understanding of such an unconventional phenomenon based on an emergent Higgs mode of the condensed holons in the doped Mott insulator. Specifically, in the lower pseudogap phase (LPP) where, although the holons still remain Bose condensed, the SC phase coherence gets disordered by excited spinons, which induce vortex-like responses from the holon condensate. By coupling to such internal fluctuations described by a mutual Chern-Simons gauge theory, we show that an external electromagnetic field can indeed produce the optical THG response in both the SC and LPP states, which are distinguished by a $\\pi$ phase shift with a substantial suppression of the THG signal in the latter regime at higher temperatures.",

    "summary": "Quantum systems coupled to (non-)Markovian environments attract increasing attention due to their peculiar physical properties. Exciting prospects such as unconventional non-equilibrium phases beyond the Mermin-Wagner limit, or the environment-assisted, robust preparation of highly entangled states, demand a systematic analysis of quantum many-body phases out of equilibrium. Akin to the equilibrium case, this requires the computation of the low-lying eigenstates of Lindbladians, a problem challenging conventional approaches for simulating quantum many-body systems. Here, we undertake a first step to overcome this limitation and introduce a tensor-network-based framework to compute systematically not only steady states, but also low-lying excited states with unprecedented precision for large, driven quantum many-body systems. Our framework is based on recent advances utilizing complex-time Krylov spaces, and we leverage these ideas to create a toolbox tailored to solve the challenging non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem ubiquitous in open quantum systems. At the example of the interacting Bose-Hubbard model driven by dissipation-assisted hopping, we demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy, enabling us to perform a reliable finite-size scaling analysis of the spectral gap and demonstrating the existence of anomalous relaxation. This method unlocks the capability of spectral analysis of generic open quantum many-body systems, suitable also for non-Markovian environments.",

    "summary": "The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has spurred intense interest in exploring analogous mechanisms in other transition metal oxides. This raises a pivotal question: can cuprates, as neighbors to nickelates in the periodic table, host similar two-orbital superconductivity? Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of a series of designed Ruddlesden-Popper cuprates. Our calculations reveal that the parent compound La$_3$Cu$_2$O$_7$ is a weakly correlated metal, and hole-doping fails to induce strong correlation. We find that the actual valence of the copper cations becomes strikingly pinned around +2.3, far away from the targeted $d^8$ configuration. This valence pinning is attributed to the inherent charge-transfer nature of cuprates. We propose this mechanism as a general principle explaining the robust single-orbital physics consistently observed in the cuprate family, holding true even in materials like the high-$T_c$ superconductor Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\\delta}$ that appear structurally primed for two-orbital activity. Our results therefore conclude that the route towards two-orbital superconductivity is fundamentally obstructed in cuprates, providing a crucial constraint for the future design of high-temperature superconductors.",

In this work, we investigate the opto-magnetic response of $d$-wave altermagnets, focusing on the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect--the induction of static magnetization via linearly polarized light. We find that the direction of the induced magnetization is determined by the N\\'eel vector. Moreover, its magnitude exhibits a periodic dependence on the polarization angle of the incident light, a hallmark of the system's symmetry.

The computed phase diagram shows excellent agreement with existing experimental and theoretical data. Beyond reproducing known results, our analysis reveals that the behavior of the solid solution across different compositions and temperatures can be understood in terms of coexisting Ti cells with different symmetries, whose stability depends on the local B-site configuration. This local-phase-based approach provides a unified description of the distinct regions of the solid solution, including ferroelectric, relaxor, and dipolar glass phases, and captures the continuous evolution from one regime to another. Our findings demonstrate how atomic-level distortions drive the complex macroscopic behavior of the material.",

    "summary": "Computational materials discovery is limited by the high cost of first-principles calculations. Machine learning (ML) potentials that predict energies from crystal structures are promising, but existing methods face computational bottlenecks. Steerable graph neural networks (GNNs) encode geometry with spherical harmonics, respecting atomic symmetries -- permutation, rotation, and translation -- for physically realistic predictions. Yet maintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified, and each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders. We present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed through systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include replacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances with splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory demands. We also introduce a general-purpose equivariant layer that mixes node information via spherical grid projection followed by standard MLPs -- faster than tensor products and more expressive than linear or gate layers. On the MPTrj dataset, Facet matches leading models with far fewer parameters and under 10% of their training compute. On a crystal relaxation task, it runs twice as fast as MACE models. We further show SevenNet-0's parameters can be reduced by over 25% with no accuracy loss. These techniques enable more than 10x faster training of large-scale foundation models for ML potentials, potentially reshaping computational materials discovery.",

In this study, we use the CHGNet uMLIP to model thermal disorder in isostructural layered 2Hc-WS2 and 2Hc-MoS2, benchmarking it against ab initio data and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, which capture thermal variations in bond lengths and angles. Fine-tuning CHGNet with compound-specific ab initio (DFT) data mitigates the systematic softening (i.e., force underestimation) typical of uMLIPs and simultaneously improves alignment between molecular dynamics-derived and experimental EXAFS spectra. While fine-tuning with a single DFT structure is viable, using ~100 structures is recommended to accurately reproduce EXAFS spectra and achieve DFT-level accuracy. Benchmarking the CHGNet uMLIP against both DFT and experimental EXAFS data reinforces confidence in its performance and provides guidance for determining optimal fine-tuning dataset sizes.",

    "summary": "The paradigm of considering open quantum systems -- i.e. focusing only on the system of interest, and treating the rest of the world as an effective environment -- has proven to be a highly effective way to understand a range of quantum systems, across areas of study such as quantum optics, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and impurities in solid-state systems. A common approach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches based on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are indeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread application of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by accuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases, such as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is structured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes of the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation of information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real problems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as it is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be practical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of techniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the notion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process tensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door to the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a wide range of open quantum systems.",

    "summary": "Two terbium tellurides, TbTe3 and Tb2Te5, were studied by means of thermodynamics, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy and torque magnetometry. While crystal structure and some physical properties of TbTe3 were established previously, the crystal structure of Tb2Te5 was solved only in this work in the orthorhombic space group Cmcm with the parameters of unit cell a = 4.3120(5), b = 41.0305(76) and c = 4.2979(8) {\\AA}. In contrast to TbTe3, which experiences three successive magnetic phase transitions, Tb2Te5 orders antiferromagnetically in two steps at TN1 = 9.0 K and TN2 = 6.8 K, both readily suppressed by an external magnetic field. The third transition in TbTe3 is due to the interaction of the magnetic subsystem with the charge density waves. The interaction of magnetic and electronic subsystems in Tb2Te5 has been revealed by the pump probe. Torque measurements of TbTe3 show that the magnetic moments of Tb are oriented predominantly in the ac plane at high temperatures and switch to the b axis at low temperatures. In Tb2Te5, the magnetic moments of Tb are oriented predominantly in the ac plane at low temperatures.",

It is well documented that the introduction of dopants or defects in the lattice can be used to tune material properties for a specific application, such as in electronics, sensors, or catalysis. To design graphene with specific properties, one must achieve control over the composition and concentration of defects. This requires a fundamental understanding of the stability of defects and their interaction in a superstructure. We present a comprehensive defect structure determination approach that enables close to exhaustive enumeration of all relevant defect structures. The approach uses a combination of Density Functional Theory and machine learning to build a transferable energy model for defect formation. Henceforth, we show the capabilities of our approach for a proof-of-principle application on free-standing graphene with heteroatom defects. This allows us to provide physical insights into defect interactions and to establish a thermodynamic model to investigate how temperature affects the configuration space of doped graphene.",

Two major obstacles hinder progress: the large number of qubits required and the prohibitive cost of conventional nested optimization. In this work, we introduce a co-optimization framework that combines Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to address these limitations. This approach substantially reduces the required quantum resources, enabling the treatment of molecular systems significantly larger than previously feasible. We first validate our framework on benchmark systems, such as H4 and H2O2, before demonstrating its efficacy in determining the equilibrium geometry of glycolic acid C2H4O3, a molecule of a size previously considered intractable for quantum geometry optimization. Our results show the method achieves high accuracy while drastically lowering computational cost. This work thus represents a significant step toward practical, scalable quantum simulations, moving beyond the small, proof-of-concept molecules that have historically dominated the field. More broadly, our framework establishes a tangible path toward leveraging quantum advantage for the in silico design of complex catalysts and pharmaceuticals.",

Machine learning (ML) techniques have been established as versatile tools for addressing these challenges, offering strategies for data interpretation, experimental control, and theoretical modeling. In this review, we provide a perspective on how machine learning is being applied across various aspects of quantum simulation, with a focus on cold atomic systems. Emphasis is placed on practical use cases -- from classifying many-body phases to optimizing experimental protocols and representing quantum states -- highlighting the specific contexts in which different ML approaches prove effective. Rather than presenting algorithmic details, we focus on the physical insights enabled by ML and the kinds of problems in quantum simulation where these methods offer tangible benefits.",

Analysis of phonon modes in finite systems explains the experimental observation by low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the need of full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. Noticeably, we introduce a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine learning potentials using limited Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This approach effectively captures both covalent and van der Waals interactions, enabling accurate extrapolations of DFT calculations to larger systems with built-in error estimation.",

Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order.

    "summary": "Strongly correlated materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers, host a variety of exotic quantum phases but remain notoriously difficult to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce a powerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated within a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum conservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground states. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands and larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution, we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi liquids, within a unified framework. Our approach paves the way for understanding and discovering novel phases of matter in strongly correlated materials.",

Yet exotic phases resulting from these spatially modulated symmetries are not fully understood and classified. In this work, we systematically classify one dimensional bosonic symmetry protected topological phases protected respecting multipole symmetries by employing matrix product state formalism. The symmetry action induces projective representations at the ends of an open chain, which we identify via group cohomology. In particular, for $r$-pole symmetries, for instance, $r$ = 0 (global), 1 (dipole), and 2 (quadrupole), the classification is determined by distinct components of second cohomology groups that encode the boundary projective representations.",

By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled framework for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.",

    "summary": "Recent experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have demonstrated that moir\\'e semiconductors can be used to realize a relativistic Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir\\'e valence bands, suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states in this moir\\'e semiconductor. Based on a Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the system's moir\\'e valence band structure, focusing on both, the evolution of the Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$ in the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole filling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moir\\'e honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future experiments by twist or gate tuning, including, e.g., a non-coplanar spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial spin-density wave.",

In this study, by combining high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of the trilayer nickelate superconductor $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ at ambient pressure. We reveal a dichotomy in the electronic band renormalizations of $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ in comparison to cuprate superconductors. At a high energy scale of hundreds of meV, its band structure is strongly renormalized by electron correlation effect enhanced by Hund coupling. The resultant waterfall-like dispersions resemble the high-energy kinks in cuprate superconductors. However, at low energy scales of tens of meV, the dispersive bands are nearly featureless and devoid of any resolvable electron-boson interactions, in drastic contrast to the low-energy kinks observed in cuprates and other correlated 3d transition-metal compounds. The dichotomic band renormalizations highlight the disparity between nickelate and cuprate superconductors and emphasize the importance of strong electron-correlation in the superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates.",

Moreover, surface termination effects induce a polar field that can shift the $\\Gamma$ and $A$ pocket above the Fermi level, even for the undoped parent compound NdNiO$_2$. Finally, for an $n$-type interface, often synthesized experimentally, we find the Ti 3$d$ orbitals to become electron doped.",

Unlike the SU(2) case, we observe a chiral-reversed quantum phase transition, where each competing phase is adiabatically connected to one of the chiral Haldane phases predicted in the SU(3) AFH chain with local adjoint representation. In the vicinity of the Heisenberg point, we identify a symmetry-protected topological state that appears at the first excited energy level. We also study the spontaneous $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry breaking of the system, and provide a variational wavefunction that captures the transition from the topological phase to the trivial phase. Finally, we propose an experimental realization of our bosonic model by two spin-1/2 bosons in an optical lattice.",

First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\\!+\\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \\textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.",

We use this method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the $J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed. In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its potential extension to different types of orders are discussed.",

The method interpolates geometry-induced weight and source terms in separable spline spaces and computes their tensor-train (TT) representations via the alternating minimal energy (AMEn) solver, enabling level-wise assembly of system operators using univariate quadrature. To recover separability in the adaptive setting, we reduce the active basis to tensor-product domains and partition active/non-active cells into a small number of Cartesian cuboids, so each contributes a Kronecker factor that is accumulated and rounded in TT. We realize the two-scale relation with truncation in low rank and assemble the global hierarchical operators in a block TT format suitable for iterative solvers. A prototype MATLAB implementation built on the GeoPDEs package and the TT-Toolbox demonstrates that, for model problems with moderately complex refinement regions, the approach reduces memory footprint and assembly time while maintaining accuracy; we also discuss limitations when ranks grow with geometric or refinement complexity. This framework advances scalable adaptive IgA with THB-splines, particularly in three dimensions.",

In this Letter, we show how parity-time (PT) symmetry enriches non-Hermitian critical points, giving rise to a topologically distinct non-unitary universality class. By analytically investigating non-Hermitian free fermion models with $PT$ symmetry, we uncover a new class of conformally invariant non-unitary critical points that host robust topological edge modes. Remarkably, the associated topological degeneracy is surprisingly encoded in the purely imaginary part of the entanglement entropy scaling-a feature absent in Hermitian systems. The underlying mechanism for the emergence of edge states at non-Hermitian criticality is traced to a generalized mass inversion that is absent in Hermitian systems.",

By evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution, we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi liquids, within a unified framework.

These fixed-point tensor networks, obtained by triangulating Euclidean CFT path integrals, allow us to explicitly construct the canonical purification via cutting-and-gluing CFT path integrals. Employing modular flow in the large-$c$ limit, we demonstrate that these intrinsic CFT manipulations reproduce bulk geometric prescriptions, without assuming the AdS/CFT dictionary. The emergence of bulk geometry is traced to coarse-graining over heavy states in the large-$c$ limit. Universal coarse-grained BCFT data for compact 2D CFTs, through the relation to Liouville theory with ZZ boundary conditions, yields hyperbolic geometry on the Cauchy slice. The corresponding averaged replica partition functions reproduce all candidate EWs, arising from different averaging patterns, with the dominant one providing the correct RE and EW. In this way, many heuristic tensor-network intuitions in toy models are made precise and established directly from intrinsic CFT data.",

    "summary": "In this Letter, we report the observation of disorder-driven anisotropic Kondo screening and spontaneous Hall effect in bulk WTe${_2}$, a nonmagnetic type-II Weyl semimetal. We show that Kondo scattering emerges more prominently in disordered samples and produces magnetoresistance that is strongly anisotropic with respect to both current and magnetic field orientation, reflecting the underlying type-II Weyl dispersion. Strikingly, we find a spontaneous Hall effect in zero magnetic field, whose magnitude is enhanced with disorder, together with a large second-harmonic Hall signal exhibiting quadratic current scaling. Our analysis indicates that disorder-driven Kondo interactions pin the Fermi level near the Weyl nodes. This enhances the Berry curvature-driven nonequilibrium transport, accounting for both the second-order and spontaneous Hall responses. These findings establish disordered WTe${_2}$ as a platform hosting Weyl-Kondo fermions and highlight disorder as an effective control knob for inducing correlated topological phases in weakly correlated Weyl semimetals.",

    "summary": "High-pressure crystal structure prediction (CSP) underpins advances in condensed matter physics, planetary science, and materials discovery. Yet, most large atomistic models are trained on near-ambient, equilibrium data, leading to degraded stress accuracy at tens to hundreds of gigapascals and sparse coverage of pressure-stabilized stoichiometries and dense coordination motifs. Here, we introduce OpenCSP, a machine learning framework for CSP tasks spanning ambient to high-pressure conditions. This framework comprises an open-source pressure-resolved dataset alongside a suite of publicly available atomistic models that are jointly optimized for accuracy in energy, force, and stress predictions. The dataset is constructed via randomized high-pressure sampling and iteratively refined through an uncertainty-guided concurrent learning strategy, which enriches underrepresented compression regimes while suppressing redundant DFT labeling. Despite employing a training corpus one to two orders of magnitude smaller than those of leading large models, OpenCSP achieves comparable or superior performance in high-pressure enthalpy ranking and stability prediction. Across benchmark CSP tasks spanning a wide pressure window, our models match or surpass MACE-MPA-0, MatterSim v1 5M, and GRACE-2L-OAM, with the largest gains observed at elevated pressures. These results demonstrate that targeted, pressure-aware data acquisition coupled with scalable architectures enables data-efficient, high-fidelity CSP, paving the way for autonomous materials discovery under ambient and extreme conditions.",

    "summary": "The machine learning based approaches efficiently solves the goal of searching the best materials candidate for the targeted properties. The search for topological materials using traditional first-principles and symmetry-based methods often requires lots of computing power or is limited by the crystalline symmetries. In this study, we present frequency-based statistical descriptors for machine learning-driven topological material's classification that is independent of crystallographic symmetry of wave functions. This approach predicts the topological nature of a material based on its chemical formula. With a balanced dataset of 3910 materials, we have achieved classification accuracies of 82\\% with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and 83\\% with the Random Forest (RF) model, where both models have trained on common frequency based features. We have checked the performances of the models using $5-fold$ cross-validation approach. Further, we have validated the models on a dataset of unseen binary compounds and have efficiently identified 22 common materials using both the models. Next, we implemented the $first-principles$ approach to confirm the topological nature of these predicted materials and found the topological signatures of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the implications of frequency-based descriptors is a practical and less complex way to find novel topological materials with certain physical post-processing filters. This approach lays the groundwork for scalable, data-driven topological property screening of complex materials.",

Here, we use entanglement microscopy--full tomography of the reduced density matrix of small subregions and subsequent extraction of their quantum correlations--to resolve the entanglement architecture near such exotic critical points. We focus on genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling of RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and unconventional XY$^*$, and N\\'eel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a dichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while non-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy configurations. Key signatures at non-Landau criticality include the absence of three-spin GME, and the loss of non-loopy entanglement in unicursal regions. Similar results in a critical resonating valence bond wavefunction confirm this multipartite entanglement structure as a common feature of emergent gauge theories. Our findings reveal a distinct entanglement architecture in beyond-Landau quantum critical theories.",

    "summary": "Quantum spin liquids with long-range entanglement are of great interest for applications in quantum technology. The quantum spin ice Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is a promising example, where it is believed that structural disorder plays a key role in enhancing quantum mechanical effects by introducing strains that split the ground state doublet akin to the effect of a local disordered transverse field. However, the precise defect structure responsible for this behaviour is unknown. Here we have determined the intrinsic defect structure of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ using neutron and x-ray scattering techniques supported by density functional theory. We find the main defect is the stuffing of Zr$^{4+}$ sites by Pr$^{3+}$ ions, accompanied by charge compensating O$^{2-}$ vacancies, and the relaxation of a neighbouring O$^{2-}$ ion to an interstitial site. Our results explain the single-ion magnetism by considering the non-magnetic singlets that arise on neighbouring sites as a result of the defect structure. These singlets account for additional features in the crystal electric field excitations. The effects caused by this low level of structural disorder are magnified since several neighbouring Pr sites are affected. This makes a significant contribution towards the observed broadening of pinch points in the magnetic diffuse scattering, which was previously attributed purely to quantum effects.",

Our results were obtained using cluster dynamical mean field theory for the two-dimensional Hubbard model. In the weakly correlated Fermi liquid regime, both quantities are approximately symmetric around the Lifshitz transition doping $p_{LT}$. In the strongly correlated regime, the low-doping pseudogap leads to an asymmetric, discontinuous evolution when the Fermi surface changes from hole-like to electron-like at $p_{LT}$. The Lifshitz transition thus changes character because it is tied to the pseudogap-Fermi-liquid transition.

    "summary": "Void nucleation in ductile materials subjected to high strain-rate loading remains a critical yet elusive phenomenon to understand. Traditional methods to understand void nucleation typically rely on experiments and molecular dynamics and do not capture the underlying factors leading to void nucleation. In this study, a convolutional neural network, specifically a U-Net enhanced with attention gates is developed, to predict void nucleation probability in pristine tantalum microstructures. The approach leverages a multi-channel input, incorporating four channels of grain orientations and an additional channel of grain boundary energy calculated via the lattice matching method. Void nucleation probability fields are determined from post-mortem micrographs and serve as ground truth, distinguishing void from no-void regions at the pixel level. Pixel-level class imbalance, commen in such images, is addressed by using Focal loss to guide the network's training to predict void nucleation sites more effectively. The model not only predicts void nucleation sites consistent with ground-truth but also reveals additional potential void nucleation sites, capturing the stochastic nature of void nucleation. This study shows that CNN-based models can predict void nucleation sites while considering combined interplay of factors such as grain boundary energy and grain orientation. In this way, machine learning can serve as a means to understand the underlying factors leading to void nucleation thereby contributing to a fundamental understanding of failure due to spallation in ductile materials.",

    "summary": "Copolymers are highly versatile materials with a vast range of possible chemical compositions. By using computational methods for property prediction, the design of copolymers can be accelerated, allowing for the prioritization of candidates with favorable properties. In this study, we utilized two distinct representations of molecular ensembles to predict the seven different physical polymer properties copolymers using machine learning: we used a random forest (RF) model to predict polymer properties from molecular descriptors, and a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the same properties from 2D polymer graphs under both a single- and multi-task setting. To train and evaluate the models, we constructed a data set from molecular dynamic simulations for 140 binary copolymers with varying monomer compositions and configurations. Our results demonstrate that descriptors-based RFs excel at predicting density and specific heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp) and volume (Cv) because these properties are strongly tied to specific molecular features captured by molecular descriptors. In contrast, graph representations better predict expansion coefficients ({\\gamma}, {\\alpha}) and bulk modulus (K), which depend more on complex structural interactions better captured by graph-based models.

    "summary": "Establishing a mapping between nanocatalysts structure and their catalytic properties is essential for efficient design. To this end, we demonstrate the accuracy of a general machine learning framework on a representative and challenging application: predicting the mass activity of Pt nanoparticles for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, estimated via a microkinetic model. Accurate models are obtained when leveraging either a nanocatalyst's structure representation accessible at the computational level, namely the surface site generalized coordination number distributions, or one accessible experimentally, namely the nanoparticle's pair distance distribution function. Building on this result, we demonstrate that our machine learning model, in tandem with Bayesian optimization, efficiently identifies the Top-10 and Top-100 most active structures out of a large pool of candidates comprising more than 50000 different structures, after probing the activity only of a few thousand structures. These findings provide a robust blueprint for accelerated theoretical and experimental identification of active nanocatalysts.",

We focus on the influence of the onsite Hubbard $U_{dd}$ and charge transfer energy scale $\\epsilon_p$ on the electronic properties via the orbital occupancies, local moments, spin correlations, and spectral properties. Rich features of the orbital-resolved local and momentum-dependent spectra are revealed to associate with the possible Zhang-Rice singlet (ZRS) breakdown reflected by the peak splitting near the Fermi level in the heavily overdoped regime. Moreover, the pseudogap features at small charge transfer energy scale (relevant to cuprates) are shown to diminish at larger $\\epsilon_p$, which implies the weakening or absence of the pseudogap in the infinite-layer nickelates. Besides, an optimal value of $\\epsilon_p$ is identified for maximizing the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin correlations. Our large-scale simulations provide new insights on the well-established Emery model, particularly in the regime of heavily overdoped and/or large charge transfer energy scale.",

Despite these advances, crafting NNIPs remains complex, demanding specialized expertise in both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the creation of accurate NNIPs. Our approach integrates density-functional theory, data augmentation strategies and classical molecular dynamics to systematically explore the potential energy landscape. Our active-learning strategy leverages on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against true errors to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of our active learning strategy, which is shown to minimize both false positives and false negatives when deciding what to relabel with ab initio calculations. The method is validated on the fully automated training of a NNIP for a diverse set of carbon allotropes, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency. This platform democratizes NNIP development, empowering users to achieve high-precision simulations with minimal human intervention.",

    "summary": "The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations, which for spinful systems are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\\nu=\\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.",

In this work, we investigate the effects of training ML potentials to density functional theory data calculated with different pseudopotentials in nickel. We look in detail at the differences that appear in radiation damage simulations. The use of a \"harder\" pseudopotential with semicore electrons has a direct impact on the short-range interactions, which in turn has implications on the radiation damage simulations. We find that despite these differences, the average threshold displacement energy is quite similar (40-50 eV for Ni). However, we find significant differences in the cumulative damage predicted by massively overlapping cascade simulations and compare them with Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy/channeling experiments. We also investigate approaches to modify the repulsive pair interactions after training the potentials and discuss the feasibility of such approaches.",

Here we investigate whether this advantage is reflected in quantum magic, quantified through stabilizer R\\'enyi entropies (SREs). We analyze one-dimensional models with an exact duality between a symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial one. Surprisingly, a finite (parameters dependent) asymmetry appears only when boundary conditions break the duality, and emerges as well in the transverse-field Ising chain, which lacks topological order. These results complement recent analysis in the literature and show that the total magic of a state is unable to detect topological phases, indicating either that a different property is required to capture their unique quantum contribution, or that not all forms of long-range entanglement constitute a genuine computational resource.",

    "summary": "Understanding the excitations of quantum materials is essential for unraveling how their microscopic constituents interact. Among these, particle-hole excitations form a particularly important class, as they govern fundamental processes such as screening, dissipation, and transport. In metals, the continuum of electron-hole excitations is described by the Lindhard function. Although central to the theory of Fermi liquids, the corresponding Lindhard continuum has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report its direct observation in the weakly correlated metal MgB$_{2}$ using ultra-soft resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). We resolve a linearly dispersing excitation with velocity comparable to the Fermi velocity and find quantitative agreement with simulations of the non-interacting charge susceptibility. A detailed analysis and decomposition of the simulations reveal the intra-band origin of this low-energy excitation, confirming it as the Lindhard continuum. Our results establish ultra-soft RIXS as a momentum-resolved probe of the fermiology in metals and call for deeper investigations of continuum features in RIXS and related spectroscopy of other materials beyond MgB$_{2}$.",

    "summary": "We generalize the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model to a spin-\\(S\\) ferromagnetic model with exactly-written ground states, known as the partially-magnetized valence bond solid (VBS) states with magnetization $m=(S-1)/S$.   We find that the VBS state and an antiferromagnetic ground state with magnetization $m=0$ are degenerate for $S=3/2$ and $S=2$ by using the Lanczos method and the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG).   However, increasing $S$, the magnetization of the ground states is uniquely determined as the fraction $m=(S-1)/S$.   This is not just a ferromagnet, but a quantum ferromagnet due to quantum entanglement inherent in VBS states.   In the low-energy excitation spectrum, we find the coexistence of the Haldane gap and Goldstone-like ferromagnetic magnon excitation.   This ``magnetic chimera'' clearly appears under a finite magnetic field.   Finally, we discuss an application to the measurement-based quantum computation and an extension of the Haldane's conjecture.",

In this work, we investigate the opto-magnetic response of $d$-wave altermagnets, focusing on the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect--the induction of static magnetization via linearly polarized light. We find that the direction of the induced magnetization is determined by the N\\'eel vector. Moreover, its magnitude exhibits a periodic dependence on the polarization angle of the incident light, a hallmark of the system's symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect provides both a method of manipulating altermagnetic magnetization in altemagnets and a probe of their intrinsic properties.",

The key contribution of this work is the tensorization process based on a tensor-train reformulation of the second-order accurate finite difference method. We advance the solution in time by combining the finite difference method with an explicit and implicit Euler method and with the Crank-Nicolson method. We solve the linear system arising at each time step from the implicit and semi-implicit time-marching schemes through a matrix-free preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method, appositely designed to exploit the separation of variables induced by the tensor-train format. We assess the performance of our method through extensive numerical experimentation, demonstrating that the tensor-train design offers a robust and highly efficient alternative to the traditional approach. Indeed, the usage of this type of representation leads to massive time and memory savings while guaranteeing almost identical accuracy with respect to the traditional one. These features make the method particularly suitable to tackle challenging high-dimensional problems.",

In this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA) framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop, rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the critical need for more efficient inference techniques.",

These findings are supported by a complementary large-$N$ saddle point analysis, which identifies the striped hybridization pattern as the energetically preferred configuration.

This method integrates memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT) with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), extending our recent work on MKCT to strongly correlated systems. The method establishes that correlation functions can be derived from the moments. Within our framework, operators and wavefunctions are represented as matrix product operators (MPOs) and matrix product states (MPSs), respectively. Crucially, the repeated application of the Liouville operator is achieved through an iterative procedure analogous to the DMRG algorithm itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MKCT-DMRG by computing the spectral function of the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we successfully apply the method to compute the electronic friction in the Hubbard-Holstein model. In all cases, the results show excellent agreement with time-dependent DMRG (TD-DMRG) benchmarks. The advantage of MKCT-DMRG over TD-DMRG is the computational efficiency, which avoids expensive real-time propagation in TD-DMRG. These findings establish MKCT-DMRG as a promising and accurate framework for simulating challenging dynamical properties in strongly correlated quantum systems.",

We focus on the massive Schwinger model, a low-dimensional analog of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), as they share important properties such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Starting from an initial state that puts a localized excitation atop the vacuum and mimics the energy deposition from colliding nuclei, we observe hydrodynamic behavior consistent with Bjorken flow in all relevant degrees of freedom: energy density, fluid velocity, and bulk pressure. The time scale for hydrodynamic onset aligns with the thermalization time of the quantum distribution function.",

    "summary": "A key challenge in quantum complexity is how entanglement structure emerges from dynamics, highlighted by advances in simulators and information processing. The Lieb--Robinson bound sets a locality-based speed limit on information propagation, while the Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem gives a universal constraint on entanglement growth. Yet, SIE bounds only total entanglement, leaving open the fine entanglement structure. In this work, we introduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling power of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for R\\'enyi entanglement growth at $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ tail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which growth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking entanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a generalized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central principle of many-body physics to general interactions. Practically, we show that 1D long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states. This closes the quasi-polynomial gap and proves such systems are simulable with polynomial complexity comparable to short-range models. By controlling R\\'enyi entanglement, we also derive the first rigorous precision-guarantee bound for the time-dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend SIE and provide a unified framework that reveals the detailed structure of quantum complexity.",

    "summary": "Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface. Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection, and dataset optimization.",

Our findings reveal that entangling strategy significantly impacts resource scaling, with circular and shifted circular alternating strategies showing steepest scaling. Ring topology demonstrates slowest resource scaling for most QML models, while Tree Tensor Networks lose their logarithmic depth advantage after compilation.

In particular, diagnosing long-range entanglement through the entropic area law suffers from spurious contributions, failing to unambiguously identify topological order. Here we devise a protocol based on the ZX calculus, a graphical tensor network, to determine the topological order of a state circumventing entropy calculations. The protocol takes as input real-space bipartitions of a state and returns a ZX contour diagram, $\\mathcal{D}_{\\partial A}$, displaying long-range graph connectivity only for long-range entangled states. We validate the protocol by showing that the contour diagrams of the toric and color codes are equivalent except for the number of non-local nodes, which differentiates their topological order. The number of these nodes is robust to the choice of the boundary and ground-state superposition, and they are absent for trivial states, even those with spurious entropy contributions. Our results single out ZX calculus as a tool to detect topological long-range entanglement by leveraging the advantages of diagrammatic reasoning against entropic diagnostics.",

Such universal functions have a distinctive local geometry, a \"texture,\" which can be characterized by the inner function's Jacobian $J({\\mathbf{x}})$, as $\\mathbf{x}$ varies over the data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers of $J(\\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor statistics of $J(\\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of $J(\\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the \"flip side\" of KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.",

This framework permits per-Gaussian decomposition of the free energy, providing a description of local thermodynamic states with atomic resolution. However, existing formulations are limited to classical pairwise interatomic potentials, restricting their applicability to specific materials and compromising quantitative accuracy. In this work, we extend the atomic-scale phase-field methodology by incorporating universal machine learning interatomic potentials, thereby generalizing the free energy functional to many-body systems. This extension enhances both the accuracy and transferability of the approach. We demonstrate the method by applying it to bulk copper under NVT and NPT ensembles, where the predicted pressures and equilibrium lattice constants show excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations, validating the theoretical framework. Furthermore, we apply the method to {\\Sigma}5(310)[001] grain boundaries in copper, enabling the visualization of local free energy distributions with atomic-scale resolution. The results reveal a pronounced free energy concentration at the grain boundary core, capturing the thermodynamic signature of the interface. This study establishes a versatile and accurate framework for atomic-scale thermodynamic modeling, significantly broadening the scope of phase-field approaches to include complex materials and defect structures.",

The phase rigidity of the SC condensate in unconventional superconductors, on the other hand, can be low enough to enable destruction of superconductivity via phase incoherence and persistence of an energy gap even at the absence of macroscopic superconductivity above Tc. This is considered a possible mechanism of the pseudogap (PG) state of cuprate high temperature superconductors (HTSCs). We have investigated the electronic energy ({\\omega}) and momentum-separation vector (q) dependence of the joint density of states (JDOS), derived from the autocorrelated Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) data, from moderately underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\\delta}HTSC samples at temperatures below and above Tc. We found that q-space structure of the constant {\\omega} JDOS intensity maps and the dispersions of the JDOS peaks are essentially the same both below and above Tc. Furthermore, the dispersions of the JDOS peaks above Tc are particle-hole symmetric. These observations evince similarity between the nature of the energy gap below and above Tc, which supports preformed pairing scenario for the PG state at least in the moderately underdoped regime.",

The interaction is parametrized by its magnitude and an angle defined by the relative orientation of the spins in different chains. From the entanglement spectrum, we identify the critical lines separating distinct magnetically ordered phases, with the interaction angle able to shift or fully suppress the transition. By increasing the coupling strength, the systems is driven through a quantum phase transition, leading to the formation of two types of in-plane antiferromagnetic stripes. The interaction strength sets stripe formation, while the angle controls the spins orientations. The chiral interaction also induces a non-trivial finite vector spin chirality with opposite orientation on the chains. We show that the vector spin chirality emerges smoothly from the decoupled limit and occurs for angles different from zero and $\\pi/2$, where collinear order is favored instead.",

    "summary": "Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment. Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.",

    "summary": "Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.",

Second, by examining the evolution of the electric field and charge density, we observe the signal of spontaneous parity symmetry breaking phase transition in a dynamical system. The parity-restored regime is marked by ''string breaking'' and efficient charge screening, while the parity-broken regime displays stable propagation of nearly free charges and persistent electric fields connecting them.",

Our method maintains approximate superlinear convergence despite inexact computations in the tensor format and leverages a primal-dual infeasible interior-point framework. In experiments on Maximum Cut, Maximum Stable Set, and Correlation Clustering, the tensor-train interior point method handles problems up to size $2^{12}$ with duality gaps around $10^{-6}$ in approximately 1.5~h and using less than 2~GB of memory, outperforming state-of-the-art solvers on larger instances. Moreover, numerical evidence indicates that tensor-train ranks of the iterates remain moderate along the interior-point trajectory, explaining the scalability of the approach. Tensor-train interior point methods offer a promising avenue for problems that lack traditional sparsity or low-rank structure, exploiting tensor-train structures instead.",

However, their scalable applications are severely constrained by low hole mobility. In this work, we take 2D-GaAs as a prototype of III-V semiconductors to investigate the effects of quantum anharmonicity (QA) on hole transport, employing the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by the machine learning potential. It is found that the room-temperature hole mobility of 2D-GaAs is reduced by $\\sim$44% as the QA effects are incorporated, which is attributed to the enhanced electron-phonon scattering from the out-of-plane acoustic polarization. The valence band edge shift (VBES) strategy is proposed to increase the hole mobility by $\\sim$1600% at room temperature, which can be realized by 1% biaxial compressive strain. The electron-phonon scattering rate is dramatically decreased due to the full filtering of the original interband electron-phonon scattering channels that existed in the flat hole pocket. The VBES strategy can be further extended to other 2D III-V semiconductors to promote their hole mobilities.",

By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across interaction strength \\( J_z \\) and dimerization \\( \\delta \\), we map out their phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at negative \\( J_z \\) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \\( J_z \\) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.",

Xia (ICALP 2010) conjectured the converse of the Holant theorem, but a counterexample was found based on \\emph{vanishing} signatures, those which are Holant-indistinguishable from 0.   We prove two near-converses of the Holant theorem using techniques from invariant theory. (I) Holant-indistinguishable $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ always admit two sequences of holographic transformations mapping them arbitrarily close to each other, i.e., their $\\text{GL}_q$-orbit closures intersect. (II) We show that vanishing signatures are the only true obstacle to a converse of the Holant theorem. As corollaries of the two theorems we obtain the first characterization of homomorphism-indistinguishability over graphs of bounded degree, a long standing open problem, and show that two graphs with invertible adjacency matrices are isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism-indistinguishable over graphs with maximum degree at most three. We also show that Holant-indistinguishability is complete for a complexity class \\textbf{TOCI} introduced by Lysikov and Walter, and hence hard for graph isomorphism.",

    "summary": "Materials engineering using atomistic modeling is an essential tool for the development of qubits and quantum sensors. Traditional density-functional theory (DFT) does however not adequately capture the complete physics involved, including key aspects and dynamics of superconductivity, surface states, etc. There are also significant challenges regarding the system sizes that can be simulated, not least for thermal properties which are key in quantum-computing applications. The QuantumATK tool combines DFT, based on LCAO basis sets, with non-equilibrium Green's functions, to compute the characteristics of interfaces between superconductors and insulators, as well as the surface states of topological insulators. Additionally, the software leverages machine-learned force-fields to simulate thermal properties and to generate realistic amorphous geometries in large-scale systems. Finally, the description of superconducting qubits and sensors as two-level systems modeled with a double-well potential requires many-body physics, and this paper demonstrates how electron-electron interaction can be added to the single-particle energy levels from an atomistic tight-binding model to describe a realistic double-quantum dot system.",

Combining accurate electronic structure theory, enhanced sampling, and machine learning, we fine-tune the MACE-MP0 foundation model and apply the resulting machine learning potentials to obtain statistically converged free energy profiles and reaction rates. We confirm that the level of electronic structure theory is important, and inaccurate density functionals can overestimate the reaction rate by up to nine orders of magnitude. We also find that harmonic transition state theory underestimates reaction rates by about one order of magnitude. For the surface reaction, we find and characterize a new, ultrafast decomposition pathway wherein the carbonyl is deeply inserted into the lithium surface and bent by about 70$^\\circ$. This reaction, which occurs in a few tens of picoseconds, generates a ring-opened intermediate that is a precursor for CO or CO$_2$ formation; by contrast, an alternative pathway that yields CO$_3^{2-}$ and ethylene is found to be non-competitive, occurring on a timescale of tens of nanoseconds.",

    "summary": "Disordered (amorphous) materials, such as glasses, are emerging as promising candidates for applications within energy storage, nonlinear optics, and catalysis. Their lack of long-range order and complex short- and medium-range orderings, which depend on composition as well as thermal and pressure history, offer a vast materials design space. To this end, relying on machine learning methods instead of trial and error is promising, and among these, inverse design has emerged as a tool for discovering novel materials with desired properties. Although inverse design methods based on diffusion models have shown success for crystalline materials and molecules, similar methods targeting amorphous materials remain less developed, mainly because of the limited availability of large-scale datasets and the requirement for larger simulation cells. In this work, we propose and validate an inverse design method for amorphous materials, introducing AMDEN (Amorphous Material DEnoising Network), a diffusion model-based framework that generates structures of amorphous materials. These low-energy configurations are typically obtained through a thermal motion-driven random search-like process that cannot be replicated by standard denoising procedures. We therefore introduce an energy-based AMDEN variant that implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo refinement for generating these relaxed structures. We further introduce several amorphous material datasets with diverse properties and compositions to evaluate our framework and support future development.",

Here we introduce a machine learning interatomic potential framework that incorporates long-range electrostatics, enabling nanosecond simulations of metal-electrolyte interfaces under applied electric bias with near-quantum-mechanical accuracy. At the benchmark Pt(111)/water and Pt(111)/aqueous KF electrolyte interfaces, we resolve the molecular structure of the EDL, reveal proton-transfer mechanisms underlying anodic water dissociation and the diffusion of ionic water species, and compute differential capacitance. We find that the nominally inert K+ and F- ions, while leaving interfacial water structure largely unchanged, screen bulk fields, slow proton transfer, and generate a prominent capacitance peak near the potential of zero charge. These results show that ion-specific interactions, which are ignored in mean-field models, are central to capacitance and reactivity, providing a molecular basis for interpreting experiments and designing electrolytes.",

In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.",

We use this method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the $J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed. In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its potential extension to different types of orders are discussed.",

In this work, we demonstrate the quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model using IBM's superconducting quantum computers, employing over 100 qubits. We introduce a first-order Trotterization scheme and extend it to an optimized second-order Trotterization for the time evolution in the Fermi-Hubbard model, specifically tailored for the limited qubit connectivity of quantum architectures, such as IBM's platforms. Notably, both Trotterization approaches are scalable and maintain a constant circuit depth at each Trotter step, regardless of the qubit count, enabling us to precisely investigate the relaxation dynamics in the Fermi-Hubbard model by measuring the expectation value of the N\\'eel observable (staggered magnetization) for time-evolved quantum states. Finally, our successful measurement of expectation values in such large-scale quantum many-body systems, especially at longer time scales with larger entanglement, highlights the quantum utility of superconducting quantum platforms over conventional classical approximation methods.",

    "summary": "The growing need for structural materials with strength, mechanical stability, and durability in extreme environments is driving the development of high entropy alloys. These are materials with near equiatomic mixing of five or more principal elements, and such compositional complexity often leads to improvements in mechanical properties and high thermal stability, etc. Thus, high-entropy alloys have found their applications in domains like aerospace, biomedical, energy storage, catalysis, electronics, etc. However, the vast compositional design and experimental exploration of high-entropy alloys are both time consuming and expensive and require a large number of resources. Machine learning techniques have thus become essential for accelerating high entropy alloys discovery using data driven predictions of promising alloy combinations and their properties. Hence, this work employs a machine learning framework that predicts high entropy alloy hardness from elemental descriptors such as atomic radius, valence electron count, bond strength, etc. Machine learning regression models, like LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Transformer encoder, were trained on experimental data. Additionally, a language model was also fine tuned to predict hardness from elemental descriptor strings. The results indicate that LightGBM has better accuracy in predicting the hardness of high entropy alloys compared to other models used in this study. Further, a combinatorial technique was used to generate over 9 million virtual high entropy alloy candidates, and the trained machine learning models were used to predict their hardness. This study shows how machine learning-driven high throughput screening and language modelling approaches can accelerate the development of next generation high entropy alloys.",

    "summary": "The spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice(PAFH) is arguably the most well known strongly frustrated quantum magnet in three spatial dimension. As a close analogy of its two dimensional cousin, namely the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice(KAFH), it has long been anticipated that the ground state of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH may host a novel quantum spin liquid. However, due to the rapid scaling of Hilbert space with the linear size of such a three dimensional system, study of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH is limited to rather small clusters and the nature of the ground state in the thermodynamic limit remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed powerful algorithm to perform large scale unrestricted variational optimization of the ground state of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH. We find that the ground state of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH features a maximally resonating valence bond crystal(VBC) pattern with $2\\times2\\times2$ periodicity. There are at least four levels of hierarchical structure in such a VBC state, with the first and the second level of hierarchy related to the breaking of the inversion and the translational symmetry. We also find that an nearest-neighboring(NN)-RVB ansatz with $2\\times 2\\times 2$ periodicity can capture very well the qualitative feature of the maximally resonating VBC state. The ground state energy obtained from the NN-RVB ansatz and the generalized RVB ansatz extrapolate to $-0.4827J/site$ and $-0.4835J/site$ respectively in the thermodynamic limit. These results, which are obtained on clusters containing as many as $N=8^{3}\\times4=2048$ sites and wave function containing as many as $N_{v}=16777216$ variational parameters, constitute new benchmarks for the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH.",

In this work we explore the opposite approach: mapping isolated bilayer systems to open monolayer systems. Specifically, we show that arbitrary bilayer Hamiltonians possessing an antiunitary layer exchange symmetry, and subject to a constraint on the sign of interlayer couplings, can be mapped to Lindbladians on a monolayer system with some of the jump operators postselected on a fixed outcome (\"monitored\"). Low-energy states of the bilayer Hamiltonian then correspond to late-time states of the monolayer dynamics. Simulating the latter by quantum trajectory methods has the potential of substantially reducing the computational cost of estimating low-energy observables in the bilayer Hamiltonian by effectively halving the system size. The overhead due to sampling quantum trajectories can be controlled by a suitable importance sampling scheme. We show that, when the quantum trajectories exhibit free fermion dynamics, our approach reduces to the auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method. This provides a physically transparent interpretation of the AFQMC sign-free criteria in terms of properties of quantum dynamics. Finally, we benchmark our approach on the 1D quantum Ashkin-Teller model.",

    "summary": "Group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$, have emerged as prototypical low-dimensional systems with distinctive phononic and electronic properties, making them attractive for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics. Yet, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ($\\kappa$) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs) including recently developed foundation models. %MACE-OMAT-0, UMA, and NEP89. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and \\textsc{HIPHIVE} against density functional theory (DFT) and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on $\\kappa$. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.",

Such near-duplicates have already skewed ground truth because past comparisons relied on discontinuous cells and symmetries. The proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for machine learning on any data objects that have ambiguous representations and live in continuous spaces. For periodic point sets under isometry (any distance-preserving transformation), we designed invariants that distinguish all known counter-examples to the completeness of past descriptors and confirm thousands of (near-)duplicates in the world's largest databases of inorganic crystals within hours on a desktop computer.",

    "summary": "The discovery of high-performance materials is crucial for technological advancement. Inverse design using multi-agent systems (MAS) shows great potential for new material discovery. However, current MAS for materials research rely on predefined configurations and tools, limiting their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we developed a planner driven multi-agent system (S1-MatAgent) which adopts a Planner-Executor architecture. Planner automatically decomposes complex materials design tasks, dynamically configures various tools to generate dedicated Executor agents for each subtask, significantly reducing reliance on manual workflow construction and specialized configuration. Applied to high-entropy alloy catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline conditions, S1-MatAgent completed full-cycle closed-loop design from literature analysis and composition recommendation to performance optimization and experimental validation. To tackle the deviations between designed materials and target, as well as high experimental verification costs, S1-MatAgent employs a novel composition optimization algorithm based on gradients of machine learning interatomic potential, achieving 27.7 % improvement in material performance. S1-MatAgent designed 13 high-performance catalysts from 20 million candidates, with Ni4Co4Cu1Mo3Ru4 exhibiting an overpotential of 18.6 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and maintaining 97.5 % activity after 500 hours at 500 mA cm-2. The universal MAS framework offers a universal and scalable solution for material discovery, significantly improving design efficiency and adaptability.",

    "summary": "The emergent practical applicability of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for approximate combinatorial optimization is a subject of considerable interest. One of the primary limitations of QAOA is the task of finding a set of good parameters. Parameter transfer is a phenomenon where QAOA angles trained on problem instances that are self-similar tend to perform well for other problem instances from that similar class. This suggests a potentially highly efficient and scalable non-variational learning method for QAOA angle finding. We systematically study QAOA parameter transferability from small problems (16, 27 qubits) onto large problem instances (up to 156 qubits) for heavy-hex graph Ising models with geometrically local higher order terms using the Julia based QAOA simulation tool JuliQAOA to perform classical angle finding for up to 49 QAOA layers. Parameter transfer of the fixed angles is validated using a combination of full statevector, Projected Entangled Pair States, Matrix Product State, and LOWESA numerical simulations. We find that the QAOA parameter transfer from single instances applied to unseen problem instances does not in general provide monotonically improving performance as a function of p - there are many cases where the performance temporarily decreases as a function of p - but despite this the transferred angles have a general trend of improved expectation value as the QAOA depth increases, in many cases converging close to the true ground-state energy of the 100+ qubit instances. We also sample the hardware-compatible Ising models using the ensemble of fixed QAOA angles on several superconducting qubit IBM Quantum processors with 127, 133, and 156 qubits. We find continuous solution quality improvement of the hardware-compatible QAOA circuits run on the IBM NISQ processors up to p=5 on ibm_fez, p=9 on ibm_torino, and p=10 on ibm_pittsburgh.",

    "summary": "Altermagnetism represents a recently established class of collinear magnetism that combines zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin polarization, enabled by symmetry constraints rather than spin-orbit coupling. This distinctive behavior gives rise to sizable spin splitting even in materials composed of light, earth-abundant elements, offering promising prospects for next-generation spintronics applications. Despite growing theoretical and experimental interest, the discovery of altermagnetic materials remains limited due to the complexity of magnetic symmetry and the inefficiency of conventional approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive high-throughput screening of the entire MAGNDATA database, integrating symmetry analysis with spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and characterize altermagnetic candidates. Our workflow uncovers 173 materials exhibiting significant spin splitting ($\\geq 50$ meV within $\\pm 3$ eV of the Fermi level), spanning both metallic and semiconducting systems. Crucially, our momentum-resolved analysis reveals that the spin splitting varies strongly across the Brillouin zone, and that the maximal splitting tends to occur away from the high-symmetry paths, a result that directly informs and guides future photoemission experiments. By expanding the catalog of known altermagnets and elucidating the symmetry-protected origins of spin splitting, this work lays a robust foundation for future experimental and theoretical advances in spintronics and quantum materials discovery.",

The multi-mode spectrum consists mainly of the intensive mode of a single correlated chain, which is surrounded and/or indented by numerous weak satellites. The number of securely fixed modes is eight at magnetic field parallel b-axis and twelve at magnetic field parallel a-axis. Besides of the multi-mode resonance observed at the transverse polarization of the microwave and static magnetic fields, we reveal a wide band of absorption by (k,-k)- pairs of quasiparticles at the longitudinal polarization. This kind of absorption of microwaves occurs both in the ordered and specific spin-liquid phases, revealing the presence of quasiparticles in the specific spin-liquid phase.",

    "summary": "Machine learning has revolutionized atomistic simulations and materials science, yet current approaches often depend on spherical-harmonic representations. Here we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion and Tensor Moment Potential, the first unified framework formulated entirely in Cartesian space for the systematic prediction of arbitrary structure-determined tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments into a complete hierarchy of (irreducible) Cartesian tensors, ensuring symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including basis sets, charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions. We demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and extended materials, including in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra, hessians, external-field response, charged systems, magnetic systems, multi-fidelity training, and heterogeneous catalytic systems. Crucially, TACE bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of spherical-harmonic-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material properties within a single coherent framework.",

We describe a chain of BLGQD with two electrons each using an atomistic tight-binding model combined with the exact diagonalization technique to solve the interacting few-electron problem. Coulomb interactions and valley mixing effects are treated within the same microscopic framework, allowing us to systematically investigate spin and valley polarization transitions as functions of interaction strength and external tuning parameters. We calculate the low energy states for single and double QDs as a function of the number of electrons, identifying regimes of highly correlated multi-electron states. We confirm the presence of a spin-one ground state for two electrons. Then, we explore two coupled QDs with 4 electrons and extend the analysis to QD arrays. Using a mapping of the BLGQD chain to an effective bilinear-biquadratic (BLBQ) spin model, we demonstrate that BLGQD arrays can work as a quantum simulator for one-dimensional spin chains with emergent many-body topological phases.",

    "summary": "The interpretation of experiments on reactive semiconductor surfaces requires statistically significant sampling of molecular dynamics, but conventional ab initio methods are limited due to prohibitive computational costs. Machine-learning interatomic potentials provide a promising solution, bridging the gap between the chemical accuracy of short ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and the extensive sampling required to simulate experiment. Using ethinyl-functionalized cyclooctyne adsorption on Si(001) as a model system, we demonstrate that conventional AIMD undersamples the configurational space, resulting in discrepancies with scanning tunnelling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data. To resolve these inconsistencies, we employ pre-trained equivariant message-passing neural networks, fine-tuned on only a few thousand AIMD snapshots, and integrate them into a \"molecular-gun\" workflow. This approach generates 10,000 independent trajectories more than 1,000 times faster than AIMD. These simulations recover rare intermediates, clarify the competition between adsorption motifs, and reproduce the experimentally dominant on-top [2+2] cycloaddition geometry. Our results show that fine-tuning of pre-trained foundational models enables statistically converged, chemically accurate simulations of bond-forming and bond-breaking events on complex surfaces, providing a scalable route to reconcile atomistic theory with experimental ensemble measurements in semiconductor functionalization.",

The interatomic forces are obtained either using the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in packages Quantum Espresso and VASP employing commonly used exchange correlation functionals (PBE, LDA, PBEsol, and rSCAN) or using the pre-trained foundational machine learning forcefields trained on two different material datasets.   We find that the considered BTE solvers introduce minimal uncertainties and, using the same interatomic force constants, all solvers result in an excellent agreement with each other, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only 1%. While this error increases to around 10% with the use of different DFT packages, the error is still small and can be reduced further with the use of stringent planewave energy cutoffs. On the other hand, the differences in thermal conductivity due to the use of different exchange correlation functionals are large, with a MAPE of more than 20%. The currently available pre-trained foundational ML models predict the right trend for thermal conductivity, but the associated errors are high, limiting their applications for coarse screening of materials.",

We also perform spectral calculations of XAS-MCD and XES-MCD based on an effective model with a full multiplet approach. While the intensity of the XAS-MCD spectra vanishes, the XES-MCD spectra exhibit finite intensity, whose spectrum becomes opposite by inverting the N\\`eel vector.

    "summary": "Inspired by the recent experimental advances in cold atom quantum simulators, we explore the experimentally implemented bosonic $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the square lattice using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. By tuning the doping level $\\delta$ and hopping ratio $t'/t$, we uncover six distinct quantum phases, several of which go far beyond the conventional paradigm of phase-coherent superfluidity (SF) expected for bosonic systems. In particular, in the presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, doped holes are tightly bound into pairs, giving rise to a pair density wave (PDW) phase at low doping and small $|t'/t|$, which is suppressed on the $t'<0$ side, resulting in a disordered PDW state that lacks coherence of either individual bosons or pairs. Upon further doping, bosons can regain phase coherence and form a SF* state, characterized by condensation at emergent incommensurate momenta concurrent with an incommensurate magnetic order. On the $t'>0$ side, the sign-induced kinetic frustration inherently disfavors local AFM correlations, leading to a phase separation in which doped holes cluster into ferromagnetic (FM) domains spatially separated by undoped AFM regions. Upon further doping, this inhomogeneous state evolves into a uniform SF + $xy$-FM phase. Finally, we propose a concrete experimental scheme to realize both signs of $t'/t$ in Rydberg tweezer arrays, with an explicit mapping between model parameters and experimentally accessible regimes. Our results reveal competing and intertwined orders in doped antiferromagnets, which are relevant to central issues in high-$T_c$ superconductivity, reflecting the frustrated interplay between doped holes and spin background.",

    "summary": "Hybrid quantum-high performance computing (Q-HPC) workflows are emerging as a key strategy for running quantum applications at scale in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These workflows must operate seamlessly across diverse simulators and hardware backends since no single simulator offers the best performance for every circuit type. Simulation efficiency depends strongly on circuit structure, entanglement, and depth, making a flexible and backend-agnostic execution model essential for fair benchmarking, informed platform selection, and ultimately the identification of quantum advantage opportunities. In this work, we extend the Quantum Framework (QFw), a modular and HPC-aware orchestration layer, to integrate multiple local backends (Qiskit Aer, NWQ-Sim, QTensor, and TN-QVM) and a cloud-based quantum backend (IonQ) under a unified interface. Using this integration, we execute a number of non-variational as well as variational workloads. The results highlight workload-specific backend advantages: while Qiskit Aer's matrix product state excels for large Ising models, NWQ-Sim not only leads on large-scale entanglement and Hamiltonian but also shows the benefits of concurrent subproblem execution in a distributed manner for optimization problems. These findings demonstrate that simulator-agnostic, HPC-aware orchestration is a practical path toward scalable, reproducible, and portable Q-HPC ecosystems, thereby accelerating progress toward demonstrating quantum advantage.",

    "summary": "Altermagnet is a newly discovered magnetic phase, characterized by non-relativistic spin-splitting that has been experimentally observed. Here, we introduce a framework dubbed {\\it spin-orbital altermagnetism} to achieve spin-orbital textures in altermagnetic materials. We identify two distinct classes of spin-orbital altermagnetism: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic type emerges from symmetry-compensated magnetic orders with spontaneously broken parity-time symmetry, while the extrinsic type stems from translational-symmetry breaking between sublattices, as exemplified by the Jahn-Teller-driven structural phase transition. In addition to directly measuring the spin-orbital texture, we propose spin conductivity and spin-resolved orbital polarization as effective methods for detecting these altermagnets. Additionally, a symmetry-breaking mechanism induces weak spin magnetization, further revealing the peculiar feature of spin-orbital altermagnetism. We also utilize the staggered susceptibility to illustrate a potential realization of this phase in a two-orbital interacting system. Our work provides a new platform to explore spin-orbital locked physics, extending the materials classes that may display complex spin textures from the standard $4d-5d$ compounds to $3d$ compounds.",

Our magnetic susceptibility $\\chi(T)=M/H$, specific heat $C_p(T)$, $^{89}$Y nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), muon spin relaxation ($\\mu$SR), and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements on this system confirm the absence of any long-range magnetic ordering and the persistence of spin dynamics down to 0.077 K. From $^{89}$Y NMR we find evidence of a transition at about 120 K which we suggest to arise from a fraction of the spins condensing into a singlet (a valence bond solid VBS or a quantum spin liquid QSL) state. A plateau in the muon relaxation rate is observed between 60 K and 10 K (signifying the VBS/QSL state from a fraction of the spins) followed by an increase and another plateau below about 1 K (presumably signifying the VBS/QSL state from all the spins). Our density functional theory calculations find a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction along the body diagonal with inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) ions alternately occupying the corners of the cube. All other near neighbour interactions between the Cu ions are also found to be antiferromagnetic and are thought to drive the frustration.",

    "summary": "Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling, incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering, capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and perturbative approaches.",

    "summary": "Computational materials science has evolved toward materials informatics, where large datasets of complex, multispecies compounds are generated and evaluated using density functional theory (DFT). Materials genome projects mine these datasets for candidates with breakthrough properties, but existing databases remain limited to compounds with relatively small unit cells due to computational cost. Exascale computers now provide the power to simulate larger and more chemically realistic systems, but fully realizing this potential requires DFT codes that can efficiently scale to thousands of processors. Our real-space multigrid (RMG) DFT code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). In this work, we present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE Python packages, pyRMG automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures, which form large, anisotropic supercells. Our results link strain and twist angle to material informatics properties, including stability and band gap, and show that pyRMG can initialize and converge challenging RMG-based workflows with limited user intervention.",

The results are validated against classical methods for calculating Curie temperatures. The experimental findings indicate that factors such as external pressure, atomic ordering, and alloy composition have a significant influence on the Curie temperatures in all examined binary systems. These factors can be leveraged to design alloys with specific Curie temperatures.

While NH fermionic systems with complex interactions exhibit superfluid (SF) breakdown with EPs, spin-dependent asymmetric hopping can stabilize a NH superfluid (NH-SF) that coexists with EPs. In this work, we investigate the quasi-one-dimensional NH attractive Fermi-Hubbard model by using NH BCS theory. We demonstrate that, when the system is regarded as weakly-coupled chains, the exceptional SF phase becomes unstable and metastable (exceptional) SF state appears between the stable SF and normal states. In the one-dimensional limit, the exceptional SF disappear entirely and EPs only appear on the phase boundary between the normal and SF states. These results reveal how dimensional crossover governs the stability of the exceptional SF, providing the insights into the interplay between dimensionality and dissipation, with potential relevance for experimental implications in ultracold atoms.",

Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.",

Benchmarking on the transverse-field Ising model, the method successfully captures dispersion relations in both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases for two- and three-dimensional lattices, achieving strong agreement with series expansion methods, where these are applicable. Crucially, this work presents the first demonstration of dispersion relation calculations for three-dimensional quantum lattice models - a long-standing computational challenge that opens entirely new research frontiers. The method demonstrates remarkable efficiency, requiring only modest computational resources while maintaining high accuracy across wide parameter ranges. Its broad applicability makes it a powerful tool for quantum simulation, photonic material design, and quantum information platforms requiring precise momentum-resolved spectra.",

    "summary": "Understanding the electronic structure of actinide materials is crucial for both fundamental research and nuclear applications. The partially filled 5f shells exhibit complex behavior due to strong correlations and ligand hybridization, requiring advanced spectroscopic techniques. Here, we report on the development and application of high-resolution valence-band resonant inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (VB-RIXS) experiments at the uranium M$_{4,5}$ edges (3551 and 3725\\,eV). We present data of UO$_2$, a well-established model actinide compound. VB-RIXS is particularly well suited for probing the 5f-shell electronic structure, as it probes, in contrast to core-to-core RIXS, excitations without leaving a high-energy core hole in the final state. In VB-RIXS, we achieve energy resolutions of 50\\,meV (M$_5$) and 90\\,meV (M$_4$), enabling the resolution of multiplet excitations and crystal-field effects, as well as charge-transfer and fluorescence-like features with unprecedented clarity. As such, high resolution VB-RIXS offers direct insights into both low-energy, near ground-state properties and high-energy hybridization and covalency effects. Our results demonstrate the power of VB-RIXS as a versatile and powerful tool for probing the strongly correlated electronic structure of actinide materials, providing essential input for quantitative modeling and the validation of theoretical concepts.",

    "summary": "The compounds 1T-TaX2 (X = S, Se) and 1T-NbSe2 have been considered as potential hosts of a quantum spin liquid phase. This is based on the widely held view that the Mott-Hubbard mechanism drives the insulating behaviour of its charge density wave ground state, resulting in localized spins, interacting antiferromagnetically, on a geometrically frustrated lattice. However this assumes layer-wise independent behaviour. A growing body of evidence shows not only that inter-layer interactions are very significant in 1T-TaS2, but also that they mediate some of its most interesting functional properties. Here we offer a perspective from the point of view of scanning tunnelling microscopy that helps to visualize the microscopic degrees of freedom of inter-layer interactions in bulk 1T-TaS2, and the associated impact on the local density-of-states, including the occurrence of multiple distinct insulating phases. We consider to what extent the bulk of 1T-TaS2, and its surface terminations can be considered as Mott insulating and whether, or where, quantum spin liquid behaviour might persist. To better understand the bulk behaviour we also draw insights from measurements on isolated monolayers of 1T-TaX2 and 1T-NbSe2, where the confounding complications of inter-layer interactions are absent. We highlight some outstanding questions raised by a comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results, and finally suggest future experiments that could address them.",

    "summary": "This work explores the role of oxygen in industrial methane oxidation. Oxygen, a well-known oxidizing agent, drives CH$_4$ conversion to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O. We report how oxygen influences oxidation on single Pd and PdO clusters supported on CeO$_2$(111). Oxygen is introduced by (1) lattice O in PdO and (2) O$_2$ adsorption on an isolated Pd atom, forming PdO$_x$ clusters. Density-functional theory (DFT) mapped multiple reaction pathways on the Pd$_1$/PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$(111) surface; both Pd and PdO clusters were found to thermodynamically favour methane activation. The computed barrier for CH$_4$ activation is 0.63 eV on PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$(111). A single Pd atom markedly accelerates O$_2$ dissociation to PdO$_2$, and the presence of lattice oxygen lowers this barrier by 0.36 eV relative to an oxygen-deficient surface, enhancing catalytic efficiency. Reaction selectivity, coverage-dependent production rates, degree of rate control (DRC), and intrinsic turnover frequency (TOF) were quantified through steady-state microkinetic modelling. The simulations predict full conversion of CH$_4$ to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O above 600 K, whereas partial-oxidation intermediates dominate at lower temperature and high O coverage. Rate constants for all elementary steps were derived via the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) symbolic-regression method, yielding a concise predictive expression based on charge, coordination number, and key Pd-O/C-H distances. These combined DFT-microkinetic-SISSO results clarify oxygen's mechanistic participation and provide practical guidelines for designing Pd/CeO$_2$ catalysts with improved activity toward methane oxidation, a reaction of pressing environmental and industrial importance.",

Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering down to $1.8$~K in spite of a significant antiferromagnetic exchange between Yb$^{3+}$ moments, suggesting a frustrated magnetic system. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate insulating behavior, consistent with the localized nature of magnetic moments. Heat capacity reveals that CuYbSe$_2$ can be treated as an effective spin $S = 1/2$ triangular lattice antiferromagnet below $\\sim 50$~K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystals reveals weak magnetic anisotropy.

We present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict $T_{\\mathrm{C}}$ using a curated dataset of 2,500 ferromagnetic compounds, employing two types of elemental descriptor-based features: one based on stoichiometry-weighted descriptors, and the other leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). CatBoost trained on the stoichiometry-weighted descriptors achieved an $R^2$ score of 0.87, while the use of GNN-based representations led to a further improvement, with CatBoost reaching an $R^2$ of 0.91, highlighting the effectiveness of graph-based feature learning. We also demonstrated that using an uncurated dataset available online leads to poor predictions, resulting in a low $R^2$ score of 0.66 for the CatBoost model. We analyzed feature importance using tools such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which revealed that ionization energies are a key physicochemical factor influencing $T_\\mathrm{C}$. Notably, the use of only the first 10 ionization energies as input features resulted in high predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ scores of up to 0.85 for statistical models and 0.89 for the GNN-based approach. These results highlight that combining robust ML models with thoughtful feature engineering and high-quality data, can accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials.

    "summary": "Catalysis at solid-liquid interfaces plays a central role in the advancement of energy storage and sustainable chemical production technologies. By enabling accurate, long-time scale simulations, machine learning (ML) models have the potential to accelerate the discovery of (electro)catalysts. While prior Open Catalyst datasets (OC20 and OC22) have advanced the field by providing large-scale density functional theory (DFT) data of adsorbates on surfaces at solid-gas interfaces, they do not capture the critical role of solvent and electrolyte effects at solid-liquid interfaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Open Catalyst 2025 (OC25) dataset, consisting of 7,801,261 calculations across 1,511,270 unique explicit solvent environments. OC25 constitutes the largest and most diverse solid-liquid interface dataset that is currently available and provides configurational and elemental diversity: spanning 88 elements, commonly used solvents/ions, varying solvent layers, and off-equilibrium sampling. State-of-the-art models trained on the OC25 dataset exhibit energy, force, and solvation energy errors as low as 0.1 eV, 0.015 eV/\\r{A}, and 0.04 eV, respectively; significantly lower than than the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA-OC20). Additionally, we discuss the impact of the quality of DFT-calculated forces on model training and performance. The dataset and accompanying baseline models are made openly available for the community. We anticipate the dataset to facilitate large length-scale and long-timescale simulations of catalytic transformations at solid-liquid interfaces, advancing molecular-level insights into functional interfaces and enabling the discovery of next-generation energy storage and conversion technologies.",

    "summary": "Understanding doped Mott insulators is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics, with relevance to cuprate superconductors and other quantum materials. The doped Hubbard model minimally describes such systems, and has explicated some of their complex behavior. However, many open questions remain concerning the anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate doping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity upon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a recent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures. Measurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops upon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track this maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic anomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped metal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of spectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform in the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this signal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and doping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and suggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in future work. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of quantum simulation in addressing frontier problems in correlated electron physics.",

    "summary": "Training machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) on total energies of molecular clusters using differential or transfer learning is becoming a popular route to extend the accuracy of correlated wave-function theory to condensed phases. A key challenge, however, lies in validation, as reference observables in finite-temperature ensembles are not available at the reference level. Here, we construct synthetic reference data from pretrained MLIPs and evaluate the generalizability of cluster-trained models on ice-Ih, considering scenarios where both energies and forces and where only energies are available for training. We study the accuracy and data-efficiency of differential, single-fidelity transfer, and multi-fidelity transfer learning against ground-truth thermodynamic observables. We find that transferring accuracy from clusters to bulk requires regularization, which is best achieved through multi-fidelity transfer learning when training on both energies and forces. By contrast, training only on energies introduces artefacts: stable trajectories and low energy errors conceal large force errors, leading to inaccurate microscopic observables. More broadly, we show that accurate reproduction of microscopic structure correlates strongly with low force errors but only weakly with energy errors, whereas global properties such as energies and densities correlate with low energy errors. This highlights the need to incorporate forces during training or to apply careful validation before production. Our results highlight the promise and pitfalls of cluster-trained MLIPs for condensed phases and provide guidelines for developing - and critically, validating - robust and data-efficient MLIPs.",

    "summary": "Confinement of particles into bound states is a phenomenon spanning from high-energy to condensed matter physics, which can be studied in the framework of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Achieving a comprehensive understanding of confinement continues to pose a major challenge, in particular at finite matter density and in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations. State-of-the-art quantum simulators constitute a promising platform to address this problem. Here we study confinement in coupled chains of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, that can be mapped to a mixed-dimensional (mixD) XXZ model. We perform large-scale numerical matrix-product state calculations to obtain the phase diagram of this model, in which we uncover striped phases formed by the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that can be melted at finite temperature or by increasing the tunneling rate. To explore this setting experimentally, we use our quantum simulator constituted by erbium atoms with dipolar interactions in a quantum gas microscope, and observe the predicted melting of a stripe phase by increasing the particle tunneling rate. Our explorative experimental studies of thermal deconfinement of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges motivate our further theoretical study of the mixD $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT, in which we predict a confined meson gas at finite temperature and low magnetization where thermal fluctuations destroy stripes but enable spontaneous commensurate spin order. Overall, we demonstrate that our platform can be used to study confinement in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, including long-range interactions and beyond one dimension, paving the way for future research of confinement in the quantum many-body regime.",

    "summary": "Copper is a highly promising catalyst for the electrochemical CO$_2$ reduction reaction (CO2RR) since it is the only pure metal that can form highly added-value products such as ethylene and ethanol. Since the CO2RR takes place in aqueous solution, the detailed atomic structure of the water-copper interface is essential for unraveling the key reaction mechanisms. In this study, we investigate copper-water interfaces exhibiting nanometer-scale roughnesses. We introduce two molecular dynamics protocols to create rough copper surfaces, which are subsequently brought into contact with water. From these interfaces, we sample additional training configurations from machine-learning-interatomic-potential-driven molecular dynamics simulations containing hundreds of thousands of atoms. An active learning workflow is developed to identify regions with high spatially resolved uncertainty and convert them into DFT-feasible cells through a modified amorphous matrix embedding approach. Finally, we analyze the local environments at the interface using unsupervised machine-learning techniques. Unique environments emerge on the rough copper surfaces absent from model systems, including stacking-fault-induced configurations and undercoordinated corner atoms. Notably, corner atoms consistently feature chemisorbed water molecules in our simulations, indicating their potential importance in catalytic processes.",

While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS two-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact persists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large number of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and R\\'enyi entropies in ordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a necessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of black holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement negativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more general non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral. We then interpret this result from the point of view of a dual matrix integral, which we use to extend our analysis beyond the regime of validity of the genus re-summation performed in the gravitational path integral. In this regime, positivity is rescued by new saddles of the matrix integral, a one-eigenvalue instanton and a two-eigenvalue instanton. Finally, we formulate a similar puzzle and its resolution using random tensor network techniques.",

Near a QCP, the Gr\\\"uneisen ratio displays a universal divergence which is governed by a universality-class-dependent scaling function stemming from the scale invariance. In this work, we systematically investigate the universal scaling functions of Gr\\\"uneisen ratio in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin systems, including the transverse-field Ising model, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, the quantum $q$-state Potts model ($q=3,4$) and the $J_1$-$J_2$ columnar dimer model. Our approach employs the thermal tensor-network method for infinite-size 1D systems and the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC) simulations for 2D systems, enabling precise calculations of the Gr\\\"uneisen ratio near QCPs. Through data collapse analysis, we extract the corresponding scaling functions, which establish quantitative frameworks to interpret magnetocaloric experiments and guide the development of ultralow-temperature refrigeration.",

In this work, we establish a universal and exact identity from the Dyson-Schwinger equations within the Keldysh-Schwinger field theory for systems with generic bilinear interactions. Our derivation demonstrates the emergence of composite particles as \"elementary excitations\", whose Green's functions definitively determine the original single-particle Green's function. This universal relation uniquely identifies the composite particles governing correlations and rigorously connects their spectra to the observable single-particle spectrum. Thus, our exact identity reveals a new pathway toward a paradigm for understanding many-body correlated systems.",

A key limitation of traditional deep learning approaches, however, is their inability to provide reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty. Such uncertainty quantification is critical for assessing model reliability, especially in materials science, where often the model is applied on out-of-distribution data. Different strategies have been proposed to address this challenge, with deep ensembles and Bayesian neural networks being among the most widely used. In this work, we introduce an implementation of Bayesian neural networks with variational inference in the aenet-PyTorch framework. To evaluate their applicability to machine learning interatomic potentials, we systematically compare the performance of variational BNNs and deep ensembles on a dataset of 7,815 TiO$_{2}$ structures. The models are trained on both the full dataset and a subset to assess how variations in data representation influence predictive accuracy and uncertainty estimation. This analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, offering practical guidance for the development of uncertainty-aware machine learning interatomic potentials.",

    "summary": "There has been significant recent interest in layered solid-state materials containing an [M2O] square lattice layer (M = transition metal), particularly because [M2O] is the anti-type of the [CuO2] planes in the layered cuprate superconductors. In addition to the superconducting titanium oxypnictides, the [M2O] anti-cuprate layer also occurs in a wide range of layered oxychalcogenide compounds with M spanning early (Ti, V) to later transition metals (Mn, Co, Fe). The chalcogenide in question - which sandwiches the anti-cuprate layer - may be S, Se or Te, and in combination with a wide range of intervening \"spacer\" layers, many different structural families have been investigated. This review surveys the structures and physical properties of all these oxychalcogenide materials and relates these properties to their common anti-cuprate square lattice [M2O] layer. It is organised around the different oxidation states of the metal ion M, in order to explore the effects of the electronic configuration of M on the physical properties of each compound as a whole. A key part of the review highlights the use of soft-chemical modifications to alter physical properties of these materials, in the synthesis of novel van der Waals materials and other metastable compounds. Future avenues for these materials in the bulk, few- and single-layer limits are discussed.",

We present a finite-difference based algorithm to compute first-order response properties with phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) that relies on a branching correlated sampling approach. Focusing on electric dipole moments, we show that mean-field trial wave functions are sufficient to obtain high accuracy relative to CCSD(T) and experimental measurements for a set of 21 molecules, ranging in size from 2 to 18 atoms in their equilibrium geometries. As with energies, the quality of predicted dipole moments can be systematically improved with the use of correlated trial wave functions, even (or especially) in strongly correlated regimes. We show that the challenges faced by low-order perturbation theories in predicting the dipole moment of hydrogen fluoride across its dissociation coordinate are overcome with ph-AFQMC when using relatively simple trials. The key advantage of our approach over those previously reported for ph-AFQMC is its scalability to large system sizes with a phaseless bias no worse than that of a typical ground-state energy calculation; we routinely converge dipole moments for systems with more than one thousand basis functions.",

    "summary": "Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling is widely employed in materials sci- ence to predict properties of interest and extract useful descriptors for measured properties. In thermal barrier coatings (TBC), QSAR can significantly shorten the experimental discovery cycle, which can take years. Although machine learning methods are commonly employed for QSAR, their performance depends on the data quality and how instances are represented. Traditional, hand-crafted descriptors based on known material properties are limited to represent materials that share the same basic crystal structure, limited the size of the dataset. By contrast, graph neural networks offer a more expressive representation, encoding atomic positions and bonds in the crystal lattice. In this study, we compare Random Forest (RF) and Gaussian Process (GP) models trained on hand-crafted descriptors from the literature with graph-based representations for high-entropy, rare-earth pyrochlore oxides using the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN). Two different types of augmentation methods are also explored to account for the limited data size, one of which is only applicable to graph-based representations. Our findings show that the CGCNN model substantially outperforms the RF and GP models, underscoring the potential of graph-based representations for enhanced QSAR modelling in TBC research.",

Using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy on a Gallium-substituted yttrium iron garnet thin film, we show multi-neuron triggering, cascadability, and multi-input integration across interconnected neurons.

The microscopic origin of such light-induced stabilization remains unresolved. Here we investigate this problem within a minimal spin-fermion framework: a double-exchange model at half filling, augmented by ferromagnetic superexchange on a square lattice. In equilibrium, at half-filling the ordering temperature is set by the competition between kinetic-energy-driven antiferromagnetism and superexchange-induced ferromagnetism. Using quantum Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Brown dynamics for localized spins combined with mean-field evolution of itinerant electrons, we demonstrate a nonthermal mechanism for stabilizing ordered phases. Photoexcitation creates a long-lived nonequilibrium carrier population that resists thermalization and reshapes the low-energy landscape, converting kinetic-energy-driven antiferromagnetism into ferromagnetism and enhancing the critical temperature. While model-specific, our results reveal a general microscopic pathway by which light can tip the balance between competing orders, suggesting routes toward optically engineered magnetism, charge-density-wave order, and superconductivity.",

    "summary": "Simulating quantum dynamics on digital or analog quantum simulators often requires ``problem-to-simulator\" mappings such as trotterization, floquet-magnus expansion or perturbative expansions. When the simulator is noiseless, it is well understood that these problem-to-simulator mappings can be made as accurate as desired at the expense of simulator run-time. However, precisely because the simulator has to be run for a longer time to increase its accuracy, it is expected that noise in the quantum simulator catastrophically effects the simulator output. We show that, contrary to this expectation, these mappings remain stable to noise when considering the task of simulating dynamics of local observables in quantum lattice models. Specifically, we prove that in all of these mappings, local observables can be determined to a system-size independent, precision that scales sublinearly with the noise-rate in the simulator. Our results provide theoretical evidence that quantum simulators can be used for solving problems in many-body physics without or with modest error correction.",

    "summary": "The XZZX code is a variant of the surface code designed to address biased noise in realistic quantum devices. For the XZZX code, we propose a decoder based on simulated annealing (SA). Our SA decoder can be readily and efficiently parallelized, by virtue of its simple MCMC-based algorithm. To prepare an initial configuration of SA, we propose to employ recovery chains obtained by a decoder which utilizes a kind of greedy matching graph algorithm. Although $Z$-biased noise is commonly assumed in real quantum devices, we focus on $Y$-biased noise, for which the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm fails to decode accurately. Our numerical simulation for the code capacity noise model, where only data qubits suffer errors, confirmed that our SA decoder is more accurate than the MWPM decoder. Furthermore, our SA decoder attained the accuracy equivalent to that of the optimal decoder formulated by integer programming, called CPLEX decoder. In our greedy matching decoder, we randomly determine order of matching pairs of incorrect syndromes that have the same distance. This randomness brings about a variety of initial configurations of SA, which leads to faster convergence of our SA decoder. By comparing decoding times of our SA decoder, the CPLEX decoder, and matrix product state (MPS) decoder, all of which can handle $Y$-biased noise appropriately, we confirmed that our SA decoder is fastest if parallelized. This result implies a potential for combining of our greedy matching and SA decoder for practical use in quantum computing.",

Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.",

This concept has been extended to strongly correlated electronic fluids in the context of the Mott transition. Namely, upon increasing interaction strength in the Hubbard model at half-filling, one finds a first-order Mott metal-insulator transition with a critical end-point at high temperature above which a number of crossover lines are observable. Using the dynamical cluster approximation for the triangular-lattice Hubbard model, we compute the Frenkel line, another concept borrowed from classical fluids, useful to define a sharp crossover between the pseudogap and the correlated Fermi liquid. The Frenkel line in the electron fluid is defined by the appearance of back-scattering when entering the pseudogap. The signature of back-scattering is the existence of a negative value in the time-domain optical conductivity.",

    "summary": "Recent work has shown that for one-dimensional quantum states that can be effectively approximated by matrix product operators (MPOs), a polynomial number of copies of the state suffices for reconstruction. Compared to MPOs in one dimension, projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) and projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), which represent typical low-dimensional structures in two dimensions, are more prevalent as a looped tensor network. However, a formal analysis of the sample complexity required for estimating PEPS or PEPO has yet to be established. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees for the stable recovery of PEPS and PEPO. Our analysis primarily focuses on two quantum measurement schemes: $(i)$ informationally complete positive operator valued measures (IC-POVMs), specifically the spherical $t$-designs ($t \\geq 3$), and $(ii)$ projective rank-one measurements, in particular Haar random projective measurements. We first establish stable embeddings for PEPSs (or PEPOs) to ensure that the information contained in the states can be preserved under these two measurement schemes. We then show that a constrained least-squares estimator achieves stable recovery for PEPSs (or PEPOs), with the recovery error bounded when the number of state copies scales linearly under spherical $t$-designs and polynomially under Haar-random projective measurements with respect to the number of qudits. These results provide theoretical support for the reliable use of PEPS and PEPO in practical quantum information processing.",

    "summary": "Dimensionality and electronic correlations are crucial elements of many quantum material properties. An example is the change of the electronic structure accompanied by the loss of quasiparticles when a metal is reduced from three dimensions to a lower dimension, where the Coulomb interaction between carriers becomes poorly screened. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we report an orbital-selective decoherence of spectral density in the perovskite nickelate LaNiO3 towards the monolayer limit. The spectral weight of the dz2 band vanishes much faster than that of the dx2-y2 band as the thickness of the LaNiO3 layer is decreased to a single unit cell, indicating a stronger correlation effect for the former upon dimensional confinement. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations show an orbital-selective Mott transition largely due to the localization of dz2 electrons along the c axis in the monolayer limit. This orbital-selective correlation effect underpins many macroscopic properties of nickelates, such as metal-to-insulator transition and superconductivity, where most theories are built upon a dx2-y2-dz2 two-band model.",

    "summary": "Locally Purified Density Operators (LPDOs) are state-of-the-art tensor network ansatze candidates that efficiently represent mixed quantum states at scale. However, given their non-uniqueness, their representational complexity is generally sub-optimal in practical computations. In this work we perform a comprehensive numerical and analytical analysis and resolve this issue in the experimentally relevant limit where noise depolarizes the density operator into a maximally mixed state. To resolve the sub-optimality issue, we analyze two numerical tools, one analytic method, and detail the relations between them. The numerical tools used are fidelity-preserving truncations and isometric gauge transformations leveraging Riemannian optimizations over entropic objective functions. In addition, by invoking the injectivity and symmetry constraints of the maximally mixed LPDO, we also present analytical closed-form expressions for the disentangler and discuss their relation to numerical optimizers. Our work shows how, by minimizing the resources required to represent key states of practical interest in experiment, the efficiency of tensor network algorithms can be substantially increased. This paves the path for uncovering tensor network's fundamental scalability limits and latent potential in representing the wide locus of mixed quantum states that are accessible on near-term quantum devices.",

Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including cluster algorithms, provide only partial solutions, as their efficiency collapses for large systems in the presence of frustration and quenched disorder. The recently proposed Tensor Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method offers a promising alternative, yet its original implementation suffers from inefficiencies due to the lack of scalable parallel sampling. In this work, we introduce BatchTNMC, a GPU-optimized and parallelized implementation of TNMC tailored for large-scale simulations of two-dimensional spin glasses. By leveraging batch processing and parallel sampling across multiple disorder realizations, our implementation achieves speedups of up to five orders of magnitude compared with the original serial scheme. Benchmarking on two-dimensional spin glasses demonstrates dramatic gains in efficiency: for instance, on a single GPU, BatchTNMC concurrently produces 1000 uncorrelated and unbiased samples across 1000 disorder realizations on $1024\\times 1024$ lattices in just 3.3 hours, with an acceptance probability of 37%. These results establish BatchTNMC as a scalable and powerful computational framework for the study of two-dimensional disordered spin glass systems.",

    "summary": "Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations) and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly (in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of ``fiber-wise\" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we establish an \\textit{a priori} estimate for arbitrary-order derivatives of the solution to the pathwise robust Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai (DMZ) equation within the framework of weighted Sobolev spaces. The weight function, which vanishes on the physical boundary, is crucial for the \\textit{a priori} estimate, but introduces a loss of regularity near the boundary. Therefore, we employ the Sobolev inequalities and their weighted analogues to sharpen the regularity bound, providing improvements in both classical Sobolev spaces and H{\\\"o}lder continuity estimates. The refined regularity estimate reinforces the plausibility of the quantized tensor train (QTT) method in [S. Li, Z. Wang, S. S.-T. Yau, and Z. Zhang, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 68 (2023), pp. 4405--4412] and provides convergence guarantees of the method. To further enhance the capacity of the method to solve the nonlinear filtering problem in a real-time manner, we reduce the complexity of the method under the assumption of a functional polyadic state drift $f$ and observation $h$. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to reaffirm our theory. For high-dimensional cubic sensor problems, our method demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy in comparison to the particle filter (PF) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Beyond this, for multi-mode problems, while the PF exhibits a lack of precision due to its stochastic nature and the EKF is constrained by its Gaussian assumption, the enhanced method provides an accurate reconstruction of the multi-mode conditional density function.",

Although strange metallicity is crucial to understanding superconductivity in correlated electron systems, its origin remains elusive to date \\cite{hussey:2023}. Here, we present the doping-, temperature-, and frequency ($\\omega$)-dependent transport properties of overdoped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ in a wide doping range of 0.183 to 0.231. We observe that the optical scattering rate and effective mass exhibit an $\\omega/T$ scaling behaviour at a critical doping of $p_{c} \\simeq$ 0.231. Away from the critical doping, the $\\omega/T$ scaling behaviour is destroyed below a doping-dependent crossover temperature $T_\\Delta(p) \\sim |p-p_{c}|^{0.24}$. Furthermore, the optical coherence mode (OCM) observed within the superconducting dome rapidly broadens and eventually disappears as the critical doping is approached. The emergence of the $\\omega/T$ scaling behaviour of the transport scattering rate and broadening of the OCM near the critical doping strongly suggests that strange metallic behaviour is caused by quantum critical fluctuations. Our results provide compelling spectroscopic evidence for quantum criticality in cuprate superconductors.",

    "summary": "Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT, particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition in the deep interior.",

In particular, altermagnets, which simultaneously exhibit zero net magnetization in real space and anisotropic spin splitting in momentum space, have garnered significant interest for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Among these, $\\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ stands as the pioneering and most extensively studied altermagnet. While the intrinsic magnetic order of $\\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ is still a subject of active debate, numerous exotic phenomena characteristic of altermagnetism have been observed in $\\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ samples. In this review, we explore each facet of the altermagnetism through specific case studies in $\\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, systematically surveying its crystal and magnetic structures, electronic band properties, and transport phenomena. We critically assess the debate surrounding the intrinsic magnetism in $\\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, incorporating evidence from altermagnetic signatures in transport, as well as contrasting results from magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Finally, possible future research directions in this field are discussed.",

    "summary": "As a consequence of their spin-orbit entangled ground state, many $5d^{5}$ iridate materials display a peculiar double peak structure in optical transport quantities, such as absorption and conductivity. Their common interpretation is based on the presence of Hubbard subbands in the half-filled $j_{\\mathrm{eff}}=1/2$ manifold. Herein, we challenge this picture, proposing a scenario based on the presence of spin-polaron (SP) quasiparticles, and assigning a dominant SP character to the first peak. We illustrate it by taking the materials Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ as paradigmatic examples, which we investigate within the dynamical mean-field theory and the self-consistent Born approximation. Both theories reproduce nontrivial features revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and optical transport measurements, supporting our interpretation. In the case of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, we show how the SP scenario survives in the low-doped regime. Similar optical transport fingerprints are expected to be found in the wider class of $5d^5$ iridates and more generally in strongly correlated antiferromagnetic regimes, such as those found in cuprates.",

Here we experimentally realize adaptive monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.",

Increasing the interaction, the spectrum gradually splits into separate bands associated with two-hole and two-particle excitations. Despite the presence of strong correlations, we find that doublons retain their coherence and undergo long-lived Bloch oscillations, as well as rich quantum walk dynamics characterized by light-cone spreadings at strong coupling, which we analyze through the time-and space-resolved Green's function.",

PEPS are particularly relevant and successful for studying ground states of spatially local Hamiltonians. However, computing local expectation values in these states is known to be postBQP-hard. Injective PEPS, where all constituent tensors fulfil an injectivity constraint, are generally believed to be better behaved, because they are unique ground states of spatially local Hamiltonians. In this work, we therefore examine how the computational hardness of contraction depends on the injectivity. We establish that below a constant positive injectivity threshold, evaluating local observables remains postBQP-complete, while above a different constant nontrivial threshold there exists an efficient classical algorithm for the task.

    "summary": "Accurate understanding and control of interfacial adhesion between Cu and Ta$_x$N diffusion barriers are essential for ensuring the mechanical reliability and integrity of Cu interconnect systems in semiconductor devices. Amorphous tantalum nitride (a-Ta$_x$N) barriers are particularly attractive due to their superior barrier performance, attributed to the absence of grain boundaries. However, a systematic atomistic investigation of how varying Ta stoichiometries influences adhesion strength at Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces remains lacking, hindering a comprehensive understanding of interface optimization strategies. In this study, we employ machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to perform steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces. We simultaneously evaluate three distinct interface construction approaches--static relaxation, high-temperature annealing, and simulated Cu deposition--to comprehensively investigate their influence on adhesion strength across varying Ta compositions ($x=1, 2, 4$). Peak force and work of adhesion values from SMD simulations quantitatively characterize interface strength, while atomic stress and strain analyses elucidate detailed deformation behavior, highlighting the critical role of interfacial morphologies. Additionally, we explore the atomistic mechanisms underlying cohesive failure, revealing how targeted incorporation of Ta atoms into Cu layers enhances the cohesive strength of the interface. This study demonstrates how MLIP-driven simulations can elucidate atomic-scale relationships between interface morphology and adhesion behavior, providing insights that can guide future atomistic engineering strategies toward enhancing intrinsic barrier adhesion, potentially enabling liner-free interconnect technologies.",

    "summary": "Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are commonly required to have an energy gap, but recent work has extended the concept to gapless settings. This raises a natural question: what happens at transitions between inequivalent gapless SPTs? We address this for the simplest known case among gapless SPTs protected by a unitary symmetry group acting faithfully on the low-energy theory. To this end, we consider a qutrit version of the nearest-neighbor XX chain. Trimerizing the chain explicitly breaks an anomalous symmetry and produces three distinct gapped SPT phases protected by a unitary $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. Their phase boundaries are given by three inequivalent gapless SPTs without any gapped symmetry sectors, each described by a symmetry-enriched version of an orbifolded Potts$^2$ conformal field theory with central charge $c=\\frac{8}{5}$. We provide an analytic derivation of this critical theory in a particular regime and confirm its stability using tensor network simulations. Remarkably, the three gapless SPTs meet at a $c = 2$ multicritical point, where the protecting $\\mathbb{Z}_3 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry exhibits a mixed anomaly with the $\\mathbb Z_3$ entangler symmetry that permutes the SPT classes. We further explore how discrete gauging gives dipole-symmetric models, offering insights into dipole symmetry-breaking and SPTs, as well as symmetry-enriched multiversality. Altogether, this work uncovers a rich phase diagram of a minimal qutrit chain, whose purely nearest-neighbor interactions make it a promising candidate for experimental realization, including the prospect of critical phases with stable edge modes.",

    "summary": "Altermagnetism is characterized by non-relativistic spin splitting and zero total magnetic moments. In this work, intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metallic and topological phases were discovered within the ferrovalley states of sliding bilayer altermagnets. We construct the bilayer system by utilizing altermagnet monolayers with a small bandgap. The inter-layer hopping phenomenon leads to a reduction in bandgaps, and sliding engineering induces ferrovalley states. Taking the V$_2$OSSe system for example, first-principles calculations indicate that the spin-dependent inter-layer hopping in the ferrovalley state ensures a direct gap in one valley (one spin channel) and band inversion in the other valley (opposite spin channel), which is manifested as an intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metal. The microscopic model and effective Hamiltonian employed in this research confirm the universal spin-dependent inter-layer hopping in the sliding altermagnet bilayer. Further calculations imply the existence of Chern insulator and gapless surface states in the sliding altermagnet bilayer. Adjusting the sliding direction can achieve the transition between different half-metals with conducting electrons of different spins, accompanied by the switching of gapless surface states of opposite spins. This research lays a foundation for the potential applications of intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metals and topological phases in spintronics.",

In one dimension, it is known to display anomalous behavior at zero temperature for interacting fermions, reflecting the breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory. Here we show that the self-energy is also anomalous in the infinite temperature Hubbard chain, where thermal fluctuations are maximal. Focusing on the second order ring diagram, we find that the imaginary part of the self-energy diverges non-perturbatively: as a power law with exponent $-1/3$ near half filling, and logarithmically away from it. These divergences imply anomalous temporal relaxation of Green's functions, confirmed by infinite temperature tensor-network simulations. Our results demonstrate that anomalous relaxation and the breakdown of perturbation theory survive even at maximal entropy, which can be observed in cold-atom experiments probing the Hubbard chain at high temperatures.",

It couples fermionic quasiparticles with collective phase dynamics to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid stiffness. The phase sector explicitly incorporates both smooth bosonic Nambu-Goldstone phase fluctuations, renormalized by long-range Coulomb interactions, and topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-type vortex-antivortex fluctuations. The required input is the correlated single-particle spectral function, enabling direct interfacing with Hubbard-type models. The framework provides quantitative access to key superconducting observables, including $T$-dependent gap and phase stiffness, gap-closing temperature $T_{\\rm os}$, and transition temperature $T_c$, across wide ranges of doping. Using a recently proposed solvable interaction model as input, our simulations reveal several important features consistent with experimental observations in the cuprates: a $d$-wave superconducting dome in the $T$-$p$ phase diagram with a shoulder-like anomaly in the underdoped regime, a pronounced separation between $T_c$ and $T_{\\rm os}$ signaling preformed Cooper pairing, a finite uncondensed normal component persisting even at $T=0$, and the onset temperature $T_{\\rm on,vortex}$ of vortex signals, offering a consistent understanding of how strong correlations and phase fluctuations cooperate to shape high-$T_c$ superconductivity.",

Using tensor network simulations in Liouville space, we compute the single-particle Green's function and analyze its dynamics across a broad range of interaction strengths. To complement the time-domain approach, we develop a high-resolution Chebyshev expansion method within the density matrix formalism, enabling direct access to spectral functions in the frequency domain. In the non-interacting limit, we derive exact analytical expressions for the Green's function, providing a benchmark for our numerical methods. As interactions are introduced, we observe a transition in the spectral function from a sharp peak at the free dispersion to a broadened two-band structure associated with hole and doublon excitations. These features are well captured by a Hubbard-I mean-field approximation, even at intermediate coupling. At infinite interaction strength ($U = \\infty$), we exploit a determinant representation of the Green's function to access both real-time and spectral properties. In this regime, the system retains a sharp, cosine-like momentum dispersion in frequency space, while the dynamics display nontrivial light-cone spreading with sub-ballistic scaling. Our results demonstrate that strong correlations and nontrivial quantum coherence can persist even at infinite temperature.",

However, the respective roles of these orbitals in superconductivity remain unclear. Here, by combining X-ray absorption, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations on La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ single crystals, we identify ligand holes in the $p_{x,y}$ orbitals of planar oxygen and the $p_z$ orbitals of apical oxygen, which hybridize with the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, respectively. These ligand holes enable orbital-selective O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study, which reveals that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states dominate the low-energy charge excitations and are more itinerant. We also observe a $\\sim$0.1 eV bimagnon through RIXS and Raman spectroscopy, which leads to an interlayer superexchange interaction J$_z$ of $\\sim$50 meV. Our results reveal distinct contributions of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals to the electronic and magnetic structure and provide direct experimental insights to understand the RP-phase nickelate superconductors.",

    "summary": "The study of topological properties in magnetic materials has long been one of the forefront research areas in condensed matter physics. CrSb, as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism, has attracted significant attention due to its unique magnetic properties. This system provides a novel platform for exploring the intrinsic relationship between altermagnetic order and exotic topological states. In this study, we combine systematic electrical transport experiments with first-principles calculations to investigate the possible realization mechanisms of topological semimetal states in CrSb and their manifestations in quantum transport phenomena. Our high field magneto-transport measurements reveal that the magnetoresistance of CrSb exhibits no sign of saturation up to 35 T, following a distinct power-law dependence with an exponent of 1.48. The nonlinear Hall resistivity further indicates a multiband charge transport mechanism. Under high magnetic fields, we observe pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations and discernible Zeeman-effect-induced band splitting at 1.6 K. Systematic Fermi surface and band calculations combined with Berry phase analysis confirm the nontrivial topological character of this material (with a Berry phase approaching {\\pi}). These findings not only provide crucial experimental evidence for understanding the electronic structure of CrSb, but also establish an important foundation for investigating topological quantum states in altermagnets.",

However, how the associated fluctuations influence the electronic properties near the transition remains a fundamental issue. Here, by applying the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\\Gamma$A) to single-orbital systems with a partially flat band dispersion, we demonstrate that finite-correlation-length ferromagnetic fluctuations generate an emergent Luttinger surface and drive a Fermi surface expansion reminiscent of exchange splitting, even without magnetic order. We further derive an analytical expression that reproduces these effects, clarifying the microscopic origin for fluctuation-driven exchange splitting in correlated electron systems.",

In this paper, we present a unified framework that simultaneously addresses both challenges: We derive two algorithms that incrementally increase the model order and memory length along. Further we proof that the updates are performed along conjugate directions by establishing a mathematical equivalence between our proposed algorithms and equality constrained least squares systems. We present several strategies how to use our proposed algorithms for initialization and hyperparameter selection.

We introduce DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%, boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves 93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.",

Yet, accessing these dynamics is key to understanding and controlling decoherence mechanisms -- a prerequisite for designing better qubits, sensors, and memories. We leverage a matrix product state representation to introduce a numerically exact and scalable method to achieve this goal. We demonstrate that our method accurately predicts coherence and population dynamics of spin networks across a wide range of parameter regimes, encompassing nuclear spin sensors and qubits in solid-state semiconductors and molecular magnets. Our method further predicts spin dynamics under the influence of repeated light pulses, which are commonly used to mitigate decoherence and perform quantum sensing experiments. Our method thus provides reliable results for moderately-sized spin platforms spanning molecular magnets and solid-state spins that can guide the development of approximate but efficient quantum dynamics methods and enable principled inquiry into decoherence mechanisms.",

In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of non-Hermitian pairing terms on both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in the Kitaev chain. Our analysis focuses on two representative forms of pairing imbalance: uniform and staggered. We demonstrate that a uniform imbalance induces only minor perturbations to the spectrum and dynamical properties, without significantly affecting its equilibrium phase or nonequilibrium steady behavior. In contrast, even a slight staggered imbalance leads to drastic changes. At the symmetry point, it enables the resonant generation of two distinct superconducting states through critical dynamics, with the realized state determined by the direction of the bias. Both states exhibit exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. Our results emphasize the fragility of coherent dynamics in non-Hermitian topological systems and elucidate the interplay among non-Hermiticity, topology, and dynamical criticality in quench processes.",

    "summary": "The nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a powerful tool to study the nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated lattice systems, but its applicability to realistic system sizes and long timescales is limited by unfavorable memory scaling. While compressed representations, such as the recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) format, alleviate the memory bottleneck, the efficiency of QTT-NEGF calculations is hindered by poor initializations and slow or unstable convergence of globally updated self-consistent iterations. Here, we introduce a predictor-corrector solver for QTT-NEGF simulations that combines dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) extrapolation with the recently proposed causality-preserving block-time-stepping updates. The DMD predictor supplies accurate initial guesses that reduce the iteration count of the calculation, while the block-time-stepping correction ensures stable convergence even for long propagation intervals. Applying this method to the Hubbard model on a $32\\times 32$ lattice within the nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation, we demonstrate stable propagation up to times of $t_\\mathrm{max}=512$ inverse hoppings, surpassing the capabilities of both matrix-based implementations and previous QTT solvers. Our contribution is twofold. (i) We integrate tensor dynamic mode decomposition with the QTT representation, which establishes a general framework that is not limited to NEGFs. (ii) We demonstrate its practical benefits in NEGF simulations, where it enables stable and efficient access to unprecedented timescales at high momentum resolution, thereby advancing controlled studies of long-time dynamics and nonequilibrium steady states in correlated lattice systems.",

    "summary": "Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation. Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more structural information, they often fail to capture long-term atomic interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region.

    "summary": "Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become powerful tools to extend molecular simulations beyond the limits of quantum methods, offering near-quantum accuracy at much lower computational cost. Yet, developing reliable MLIPs remains difficult because it requires generating high-quality datasets, preprocessing atomic structures, and carefully training and validating models. In this work, we introduce an Automated Machine Learning Pipeline (AMLP) that unifies the entire workflow from dataset creation to model validation. AMLP employs large-language-model agents to assist with electronic-structure code selection, input preparation, and output conversion, while its analysis suite (AMLP-Analysis), based on ASE supports a range of molecular simulations. The pipeline is built on the MACE architecture and validated on acridine polymorphs, where, with a straightforward fine-tuning of a foundation model, mean absolute errors of ~1.7 meV/atom in energies and ~7.0 meV/{\\AA} in forces are achieved. The fitted MLIP reproduces DFT geometries with sub-{\\AA} accuracy and demonstrates stability during molecular dynamics simulations in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles.",

    "summary": "We investigate changes in the optical conductivity of doped Mott insulators by tuning ultrashort pump pulses to target either the Drude or low-energy absorption regions. Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight, accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases. In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to cuprate materials.",

    "summary": "Radiation damage in structural materials is a major challenge for advanced nuclear energy systems, and niobium is of particular interest due to its high melting point, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance. To better understand its radiation response, we carried out large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of collision cascades in pure niobium at 300 K over a primary knock-on atom (PKA) energy range of 1-75 keV, employing four interatomic potentials: an embedded atom method (EAM), two Finnis-Sinclair models (FS-1 and FS-2), and a machine learning-based spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) we developed. All reproduce the general features of cascade formation but differ significantly in defect production, clustering, and morphology. At low energies, defect generation follows trends governed by threshold displacement energy (TDE) and the stiffness-to-range ratio (|S/R|). At higher energies, subcascade formation makes defect evolution dependent on the combined effects of |S/R|, average TDE, and other material-specific factors. Vacancy clustering dominates over interstitial clustering across all cases: EAM produces the largest vacancy clusters and the highest clustering fraction, while SNAP shows the strongest interstitial clustering. Morphological analysis indicates that EAM forms a balanced mix of 1/2<111>, 1/2<110> loops, C15 rings, and hybrid structures; FS-2 favors extended 1/2<111> dumbbells, crowdions, and dislocation loops; whereas FS-1 and SNAP generate more compact or disordered clusters, with SNAP produces a high fraction of C15-like rings (maximum size up to nine atoms) that may evolve into dislocation loops of 1/2<111> and <100>. These findings give clear insights into how niobium reacts when exposed to irradiation, especially at high energies.",

    "summary": "Micro- and nanothermometry enable precise temperature monitoring and control at the micro- and nanoscale, and have become essential diagnostic tools in applications ranging from high-power microelectronics to biosensing and nanomedicine. Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K, resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04 K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent (sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable temperature-dependent observables.",

To address this problem, we introduce Monte Carlo diagonalization. Using a truncated Fock space constructed with a Monte Carlo approach, we reduce the size of the basis required to represent the Hamiltonian. We can then apply the Lanczos and band Lanczos algorithms in this truncated basis to find the ground state and the Green function. This results in a significant economy of resources and the capacity to break the $\\sim$20-site limit of ED. Our results suggest that there is a threshold on the number of states needed to capture the physics. This allows us to reach clusters of size up to 32 sites and reproduce the expected physics.",

    "summary": "Haag duality is a strong notion of locality for two-dimensional lattice quantum spin systems, requiring that the commutant of the algebra of observables supported in a cone-like region coincides with the algebra of observables in its complement. Originally introduced within algebraic quantum field theory, Haag duality has recently become pivotal in the operator-algebraic analysis of quantum many-body systems. In particular, it plays a key role in the description of anyonic excitations, which are widely believed to classify two-dimensional non-chiral gapped quantum phases of matter. Prior to this work, Haag duality had only been rigorously established for Kitaev's quantum double models with abelian input groups. In this paper, we establish that two-dimensional tensor network states based on biconnected $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras satisfy Haag duality. These states include as particular cases Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and we expect them to encompass representatives of all non-chiral phases. Our proof relies on deriving an operator-algebraic sufficient condition for Haag duality in finite systems, which we verify using tensor-network methods. As part of our analysis, we extend the tensor-network bulk-boundary correspondence, construct explicit commuting parent Hamiltonians for these models, and prove that in the biconnected case they satisfy the local topological quantum order condition.",

    "summary": "Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.",

    "summary": "Measuring universal data in the strongly correlated regime of quantum critical points remains a fundamental objective for quantum simulators. In foundational work, Calabrese and Cardy demonstrated how this data governs the dynamics of certain global quenches to 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories. While the quasiparticle picture they introduce has been widely successful in both theory and experiment, their seminal prediction that the critical exponents are simply encoded in the relaxation rates of local observables is more challenging to investigate experimentally; in particular, the specific initial state required for their analysis is generated via imaginary time evolution. In this work, we examine the critical quench dynamics of local observables from two types of readily-accessible initial conditions: ground states and finite-temperature ensembles. We identify universal scaling collapses and scaling functions in both cases, utilizing a combination of conformal perturbation theory and tensor network numerics. For the finite-temperature quenches, we determine a regime in which the conformal field theory results are recovered, thereby allowing universal quantum critical data to be extracted from realistic quenches.",

KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based (topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives-including a nonparametric tensor- and a neural-network-based methods-for imputing missing, time-varying edge flows.",

The latter has its own non-trivial dynamics leading to quantum paramagnetic (or liquid) and glassy phases. At low temperatures, this setup results in SYK behavior within each metastable state of a rugged bosonic free energy landscape, the effective fermionic couplings being different for each metastable state. We show that the boson-fermion coupling enhances the stability of the quantum spin-glass phase and strongly modifies the imaginary-time Green's functions of both sets of degrees of freedom. In particular, in the quantum spin glass phase, the imaginary-time dynamics is turned from a fast exponential decay characteristic of a gapped phase into a much slower dynamics. In the quantum paramagnetic phase, on the other hand, the fermions' imaginary-time dynamics get strongly modified and the critical SYK behavior is washed away.",

    "summary": "Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials. First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However, these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.",

    "summary": "Altermagnets host an array of magnetic multipoles, which are often visualized and studied in the reciprocal space. In the real space, the relative phase of the multipoles of the spin-density around atoms determines whether a system is an altermagnet or a conventional antiferromagnet. In this study, we approach these real space multipoles in altermagnets using a combination of first principles calculations and group theory. We show that even in collinear magnets, the local spin density is necessarily noncollinear due to spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, the noncollinear contributions often provide a more direct illustration of the magnetic multipolar character of altermagnetism than the collinear contribution, which is dominated by the dipolar term. Our first principles calculations also show that 32-poles, in addition to the octupoles, can be visible in spin-density of d-wave altermagnets, and they must be taken into account in discussions of the macroscopic response. Finally, we elucidate the interplay between magnetism and subtle crystal structural distortions in perovskite altermagnets, which provide a fertile playground for studying phase transitions between antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic phases.",

Finding microscopic lattice models for metallic states that exhibit such peculiar behavior remains a major theoretical challenge, as these features often originate from strong quantum fluctuations in strongly interacting electron systems. Here we investigate a three-orbital Hubbard model at a high-symmetry point that hosts a transition from a metallic to an orbital-selective Mott (OSM) phase. Employing single-site dynamical mean-field theory combined with full-density-matrix numerical renormalization group, we chart the $T-U$ phase diagram and obtain high-resolution real-frequency dynamics. In the OSM regime we find asymptotically scale-invariant (power-law) single-particle spectra and asymptotic $\\omega/T$ scaling in both charge and spin channels, spanning several decades in frequency and temperature.",

    "summary": "Accurate understanding and control of interfacial adhesion between Cu and Ta$_x$N diffusion barriers are essential for ensuring the mechanical reliability and integrity of Cu interconnect systems in semiconductor devices. Amorphous tantalum nitride (a-Ta$_x$N) barriers are particularly attractive due to their superior barrier performance, attributed to the absence of grain boundaries. However, a systematic atomistic investigation of how varying Ta stoichiometries influences adhesion strength at Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces remains lacking, hindering a comprehensive understanding of interface optimization strategies. In this study, we employ machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to perform steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces. We simultaneously evaluate three distinct interface construction approaches--static relaxation, high-temperature annealing, and simulated Cu deposition--to comprehensively investigate their influence on adhesion strength across varying Ta compositions ($x=1, 2, 4$). Peak force and work of adhesion values from SMD simulations quantitatively characterize interface strength, while atomic stress and strain analyses elucidate detailed deformation behavior, highlighting the critical role of interfacial morphologies. Additionally, we explore the atomistic mechanisms underlying cohesive failure, revealing how targeted incorporation of Ta atoms into Cu layers enhances the cohesive strength of the interface. This study demonstrates how MLIP-driven simulations can elucidate atomic-scale relationships between interface morphology and adhesion behavior, providing insights that can guide future atomistic engineering strategies toward enhancing intrinsic barrier adhesion, potentially enabling liner-free interconnect technologies.",

As concrete examples, we consider $\\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase and suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The relative importance of non-local vs. local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states: closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic field.",

One of the species is subjected to Raman assisted tunneling, which leads to a synthetic flux within the framework of synthetic dimensions. In the deep Mott regime, the low energy physics is governed by an unconventional and highly tunable spin model, which is characterized by two distinct spin chains. The synthetic flux serves as an effective spin-orbit coupling, inducing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in one of the spin chains. The inter-species spin exchange interaction gives rise to the inter-chain coupling embodied as an isotropic XX interaction. Using time-evolving block decimation method for tensor network states, we compute order parameters, correlation functions and structure factors to identify the ground state magnetic phases. The DM interaction in one species, when combined with the inter-species spin-exchange interaction, can induce spiral magnetic order in the second, otherwise non-chiral species. Besides, the interplay of a transverse field applied to one spin chain and the inter-species coupling can drive both spin chains into a paramagnetic phase simultaneously. These results reveal that inter-species coupling serves as a powerful conduit for transmitting magnetic correlations, enabling exotic phases beyond the single-component perspective.",

    "summary": "Anderson localization is a quantum phenomenon in which disorder localizes electronic wavefunctions. In this work, we propose a new approach to study Anderson localization based on the density matrix formalism. Drawing an analogy to the standard transfer matrix method, we extract the localization length from the modular density matrix in quasi-one-dimensional systems. This approach successfully captures the metal-insulator transition in the three-dimensional Anderson model and in the two-dimensional Anderson model with spin-orbit coupling. It can be also readily extended to multiorbital systems. We further generalize the formalism to interacting systems, showing that the one-dimensional spinless attractive model exhibits the expected metallic phase, consistent with previous studies. More importantly, we demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional metallic phase in the presence of Hubbard interactions and disorder. This method offers a new perspective on Anderson localization and its interplay with interactions.",

As concrete examples, we consider $\\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase. The relative importance of non-local vs. local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states: closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic field.",

Employing classifier-free guidance, we sample 200,000 structures, which lead to 34,027 unique candidates. A multistage screening process that combines machine learning and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess stability and electronic properties, identifies 773 candidates with DFT-calculated $T_\\mathrm{c}>5$ K. Notably, our generative model demonstrates effective property-driven design. Our computational findings were validated against experimental synthesis and characterization performed as part of this work, which highlighted challenges in sparsely charted chemistries.

    "summary": "The Kitaev model is an exactly solvable model with a quantum spin liquid ground state. While this model was originally proposed as an $S=1/2$ spin model on a honeycomb lattice, extensions to higher-spin systems have recently attracted attention. In contrast to the $S=1/2$ case, such higher-$S$ models are not exactly solvable and remain poorly understood, particularly for spin excitations at finite temperatures. Here, we focus on the $S=1$ Kitaev model, which is proposed to host bosonic quasiparticles. We investigate this model using Schwinger boson mean-field theory, introducing bosonic spinons as fractional quasiparticles by extending bond operators to address anisotropic spin interactions. We determine the mean-field parameters that realize a quantum spin liquid in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models. Based on this ansatz, we calculate dynamical and equal-time spin structure factors. We find that the conventional scheme based on Wick decoupling with respect to spinons yields unphysical momentum dependence: it produces strong spectral weight indicating ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) correlations in the antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Kitaev model. To resolve this issue, we propose an alternative evaluation based on decoupling with respect to bond operators. We demonstrate that, in our scheme, such unphysical behavior disappears and the momentum dependence of the spin structure factors is consistent with the sign of the exchange constant. We also compute the temperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor and find that the zero-temperature continuum splits into two distinct structures as temperature increases, which can be understood in terms of the bandwidth narrowing of spinons. Finally, we clarify why the two decoupling schemes result in different momentum dependences and discuss their relationship to previous studies.",

Here, we demonstrate that fine-tuning foundation machine learning potentials (MLPs) significantly improves both computational efficiency and predictive accuracy for surface modeling. While existing universal interatomic potentials (UIPs) have been solely trained and validated on bulk datasets, we extend their applicability to complex and scientifically significant unary, binary, and ternary surface systems. We systematically compare models trained from scratch, zero-shot inference, conventional fine-tuning, and multi-head fine-tuning approach that enhances transferability and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Fine-tuning consistently reduces prediction errors with orders-of-magnitude fewer training configurations, and multi-head fine-tuning delivers robust and generalizable predictions even for materials beyond the initial training domain. These findings offer practical guidance for leveraging pre-trained MLPs to accelerate surface modeling and highlight a scalable path toward data-efficient, next-generation atomic-scale simulations in computational materials science.",

We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.",

Yet, due to challenges in interpretability of machine learning techniques, the question of what physics machine learning models are able to learn remains open. Here we bridge the concept a physical quantity and its machine learning approximation in the context of the original application of neural networks in physics: topological phase classification. We construct a hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying the differences in trainability and representational power. Our work highlights the challenges in learning topological invariants and constitutes a stepping stone towards more accurate and better generalizable machine learning representations in condensed matter physics.",

In the present work we consider the metal-insulator transition in the model case of a 1D CuO chain in the regime of half-filling of the band.

    "summary": "The cuprates exhibit anomalous momentum-space structure with antinodal gap and nodal arc in the underdoped regime, which evolves into a complete hole-type Fermi surface with a large Luttinger volume in the overdoped regime. The real-space electronic structure is also quite complex, as characterized by microscopic inhomogeneities and intertwined density wave orders. Here we show that doped holes in cuprate form localized electronic molecules consisting of 4a0 plaquettes, and each plaquette contains approximately two holes. The effective local doping level is thus around 1/8, which is sufficient to destroy the underlying AF order and more importantly, recovers the half-filled metallic state of the original CuO2 plane. The restored Fermi surface, hosting one hole per unit cell, is consistent with experimental results and satisfies the Luttinger theorem. We then construct the momentum-space structure of the half-filled metal by considering the real-space configuration of electronic molecules. We show that the electronic potential with 4a0 periodicity imposed by the plaquettes and the quantum size effect of electronic molecules obliterate the nested antinodal Fermi surface sheets, leaving behind short arcs with coherent quasiparticles around the node. We propose that two doped holes in each plaquette occupy the shared molecular orbital and form a spin singlet, which can mediate the pairing of itinerant holes on the remnant Fermi surface of the half-filled metal. The electric dipole moment between the molecular orbitals and the dopant ions may also provide a novel attractive interaction between itinerant holes. This phenomenological model for pair formation between itinerant holes on the half-filled Fermi surface mediated by localized molecular orbitals resolves several core issues concerning the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates.",

However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric performance of high-\\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\\k{appa} oxides from a screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.",

In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition as a function of interaction. Moreover, we show that for both the non-interacting and interacting cases, topological nature of the system survives even by altering the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg, resulting in two topological phases of opposite character. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.",

    "summary": "Defects in high temperature superconductors such as YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) critically influence their superconducting behavior, as they substantially degrade or even suppress superconductivity. With the renewed interest in cuprates for next-generation superconducting magnets operating in radiation-harsh environments such as fusion reactors and particle accelerators, accurate atomistic modeling of defects and their dynamics has become essential. Here, we present a general-purpose machine-learning interatomic potential for YBCO, based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) method and trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data, with particular emphasis on defects and their diffusion mechanisms. The potential is validated against DFT calculations of ground-state properties, defect formation energies of oxygen Frenkel pairs and diffusion barriers for their formation. Remarkably, the potential captures the diffusion-driven orthorhombic to tetragonal transition at elevated temperatures, a transformation that is difficult to describe with empirical potentials, elucidating how the formation of oxygen Frenkel pairs in the basal plane governs this order-disorder transition. The ACE potential introduced here enables large-scale, predictive atomistic simulations of defect dynamics and transport processes in YBCO, providing a powerful tool to explore its stability, performance, and functionality under realistic operating conditions. Moreover, this work proves that machine learning interatomic potentials are suitable for studies of quaternary oxides with complex chemistry.",

    "summary": "Sampling the three-dimensional (3D) spin glass -- i.e., generating equilibrium configurations of a 3D lattice with quenched random couplings -- is widely regarded as one of the central and long-standing open problems in statistical physics. The rugged energy landscape, pronounced critical slowing down, and intrinsic ergodicity breaking render standard Monte Carlo methods severely inefficient, particularly for large systems at low temperatures. In this work, we introduce the Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TNMCMC) approach to address the issue. It generates large-scale collective updates in MCMC using tensor networks on the 2D slices of the 3D lattice, greatly improving the autocorrelation time and offering orders-of-magnitude speed-ups over conventional MCMC in generating unbiased samples of the Boltzmann distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on 3D spin glasses up to system size $64\\times 64\\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that TNMCMC dramatically suppresses critical slowing down in large disordered systems, which usually require a supercomputer to perform MCMC simulations. Furthermore, we apply our approach to the 3-state Potts model up to system size $64\\times 64\\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that the TNMCMC approach efficiently traverses the exponential barriers of the strong first-order transition, whereas conventional MCMC fails. Our results reveal that TNMCMC opens a promising path toward tackling long-standing, formidable three-dimensional problems in statistical physics.",

    "summary": "In quantum many-body systems, characterizing topological phase transitions typically requires complex many-body topological invariants, which are costly to compute and measure. Inspired by quantum reservoir computing, we propose an unsupervised quantum phase detection method based on a many-body localized evolution, enabling efficient identification of phase transitions in the extended SSH model. The evolved quantum states produce feature distributions under local measurements, which, after simple post-processing and dimensionality reduction, naturally cluster according to different Hamiltonian parameters. Numerical simulations show that the evolution combined with local measurements can significantly amplify distinctions between quantum states, providing an efficient means to detect topological phase transitions. Our approach requires neither complex measurements nor full density matrix reconstruction, making it practical and feasible for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.",

Herein, we uncover an intrinsic scaling law of the nonlocal magic resource and the bond dimension of matrix product states in Haar-random quantum circuits, that is, the nonlocal magic resource is converged on a bond dimension in logarithmic scale with the system size. It means, in the practical simulations of quantum circuits, merely small bond dimension suffices to bear with the dynamics of stabilizer R\\'{e}nyi entropy with rank $n=1,2$. On the other hand, the entanglement converges on a bond dimension exponentially scaled in the system size. This remarkable difference reveals that, while the simulation of entanglement on a classical computer is limited, the utilization of nonlocal magic resource as a characterization could make the simulation power much stronger. Furthermore, the intrinsic scaling enables an information separation between the nonlocal magic resource and the extra entanglement, achieving an indication that it is inappropriate to regard the entanglement as the driving force of the growth and spreading of nonlocal magic resource.",

In this free-theory regime, no genuine thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole interior.",

Both methods avoid empirical Hubbard U parameters and are free from double-counting issues. CMRT employs a Gutzwiller-type approximation that enables efficient calculations, while GCGM goes beyond this approximation to achieve higher accuracy at higher computational cost. By benchmarking against available quantum Monte Carlo results, we demonstrate that while both methods are more accurate than the widely used density-functional theory (DFT), GCGM systematically captures additional correlation energy missing in CMRT, leading to significantly improved total energy predictions. We also show that by including the correlation energy from LDA in the CMRT calculation, CMRT+ produces energy in better agreement with the QMC results in these hydrogen lattice systems.",

However, existing approaches often rely on a priori knowledge of the sign structure or require a separately pre-trained phase network. We introduce a modified stochastic reconfiguration method that effectively uses differing imaginary time steps to evolve the amplitude and phase. Using a larger time step for phase optimization, this method enables a simultaneous and efficient training of phase and amplitude neural networks. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated on the Heisenberg J_1-J_2 model.",

    "summary": "Controlling nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials requires ultrafast probes with spectral selectivity. We report femtosecond reflectivity measurements on the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ using free-electron laser extreme-ultraviolet (23.5--177~eV) and near-infrared (1.5~eV) pump pulses. EUV pulses access deep electronic states, while NIR light excites valence-band transitions. Despite these distinct channels, both schemes produce nearly identical dynamics: above $T_c$, excitations relax through fast (100--300~fs) and slower (1--5~ps) channels; below $T_c$, a delayed component signals quasiparticle recombination and condensate recovery. We find that when electronic excitations are involved, the ultrafast response is governed mainly by absorbed energy rather than by the microscopic nature of the excitation. In contrast, bosonic driving in the THz or mid-infrared produces qualitatively different dynamics. By demonstrating that EUV excitation of a correlated superconductor yields macroscopic dynamics converging with those from optical pumping, this work defines a new experimental paradigm: FEL pulses at core-level energies provide a powerful means to probe and control nonequilibrium electronic states in quantum materials on their intrinsic femtosecond timescales. This establishes FEL-based EUV pumping as a new capability for ultrafast materials science, opening routes toward soft X-ray and attosecond studies of correlated dynamics.",

    "summary": "Polarization in ferroelectric domains arises from atomic-scale structural variations that govern macroscopic functionalities. The interfaces between these domains known as domain walls host distinct physical responses, making their identification and control critical. Four dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4DSTEM) enables simultaneous acquisition of real and reciprocal-space information at the atomic scale, offering a powerful platform for domain mapping. However, conventional analyses rely on computationally intensive processing and manual interpretation, which are time consuming and prone to misalignment and diffraction artefacts. Here, we present a convolutional neural network that, with minimal training, classifies polarization directions from diffraction data and segments domains in real space. We further introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that prioritizes images from domain wall regions, reducing the number of training images required while improving accuracy and interpretability. We demonstrate this approach for domain mapping in ferroelectric boracite, Cu3B7O13Cl.",

In this work, we propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to a variety of density estimation benchmarks.

While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical mechanics to devise a \\emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially fast if an object called the \\emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum systems.",

Despite rapid progress in their experimental control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce. Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states of spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms, ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.",

    "summary": "Simulation of mesoscopic nanostructures is a central challenge in condensed matter physics and device applications. First-principles methods provide accurate electronic structures but are computationally prohibitive for large systems, while empirical band theories are efficient yet limited by parameter fitting that neglects wavefunction information and often yields non-transferable parameters. We propose a methodology that bridges these approaches, achieving first-principles-level reliability with computational efficiency through a machine-learning-enabled tight-binding framework. Our approach starts with Wannier tight-binding (WTB) parameters from small nanostructures, which serve as training data for machine learning (ML). To remove the gauge freedom of Wannier functions that obscures size- and geometry-dependent parameter trends, we construct gauge-independent (GI) bases and transform the WTB model into a gauge-independent WTB (GI-WTB) model. This enables robust parameter fitting and ML prediction of parameter variations, yielding the machine-learning GI-WTB (ML-GI-WTB) model. Applied to MoS2 armchair-edge nanoribbons, the ML-GI-WTB model shows excellent agreement with first-principles results and enables reliable simulations of sub-$\\mu$m-wide nanoribbons. This framework provides a scalable tool for predicting electronic properties of realistic nanostructures beyond the reach of conventional first-principles methods.",

We use our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by Luttinger's theorem.",

    "summary": "Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However, the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts. We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst. In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient catalysts.",

It is characterized with ordered anti-parallel orbital magnetic moments in real space but momentum-dependent orbital band splittings, analogous to spin altermagnetism. Using a minimal tight-binding model with complex hoppings in a square-kagome lattice, we show that such order inherently arises from staggered loop currents, producing a $d$-wave-like orbital-momentum locking. First-principles calculations show that orbital altermagnetism emerges independent of spin ordering in in-plane ferromagnets of CuBr$_2$ and VS$_2$, so that it can be unambiguously identified experimentally. On the other hand, it may also coexist with spin altermagnetism, such as in monolayer MoO and CrO. The orbital altermagnetism offers an alternative platform for symmetry-driven magnetotransport and orbital-based spintronics, as exemplified by large nonlinear current-induced orbital magnetization.",

GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures for molecular modeling.",

    "summary": "Rhombohedral or ABC stacked multilayer graphene hosts a correlated magnetic ground state at charge neutrality, making it one of the simplest systems to investigate strong electronic correlations. We investigate this ground state in multilayer graphene structures using the Hubbard model in a distance dependent Slater-Koster tight binding framework. We show that by using a universal Hubbard-$U$ term, we can accurately capture the spin polarization predicted by hybrid density functional theory calculations for both hexagonal (ABA) and rhombohedral (ABC) stackings. Using this $U$ value, we calculate the magnetic moments of 3-8 layers of ABC and ABA graphene multilayers. We demonstrate that the structure and magnitude of these magnetic moments are robust when heterostructures are built from varying numbers of ABC and ABA multilayers. By applying different types of mechanical distortions, we study the behaviour of the magnetism in graphene systems under uniaxial strain and pressure. Our results establish a computationally efficient framework to investigate correlation-driven magnetism across arbitrary stacking configurations of graphite polytypes.",

    "summary": "The Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism arises from interaction-driven asymmetric filling of spin bands, requiring that the spin susceptibility: (i) peaks dominantly at $\\mathbf{Q}=\\bm{0}$; and (ii) diverges at a critical interaction strength. Here, we demonstrate that this Stoner mechanism breaks down due to competition with altermagnetic orders, even when both conditions are met. Altermagnetism in solids is characterized by collinear antiparallel spin alignment that preserves translational symmetry, and inherently fulfills these requirements. As a proof of concept, we study a two-orbital Hubbard model with electron filling near Van Hove singularities at high-symmetry momenta. Our results reveal that orbital-resolved spin fluctuations, amplified by strong inter-orbital hopping, stabilize intrinsic altermagnetic order. A quantum phase transition from altermagnetism to ferromagnetism occurs at critical Hund's coupling $J_H$. We further propose directional spin conductivity anisotropy as a detectable signature of this transition via non-local spin transport. This work establishes the pivotal role of altermagnetism in correlated systems.",

However, screening promising candidates, such as semiconductors, based on defect properties remains challenging. This is primarily due to the lack of a general framework for predicting defect formation energies in multiple charge states from structural data. In this Letter, we present a protocol, namely data normalization, Fermi level alignment, and treatment of perturbed host states, and validate it by accurately predicting oxygen vacancy formation energies in three charge states using a single model. We also introduce a joint machine-learning model that integrates defect formation energies and band-edge predictions for virtual screening. Using this framework, we identify 89 hole-dopable oxides, including BaGaSbO, a potential ambipolar photovoltaic material. Our protocol is expected to become a standard approach for machine-learning studies on point defect formation energies.",

Many machine learning charge density models are developed by prior efforts, which have been proven useful to accelerate DFT calculations. Yet they all use the total charge density (TCD) as the training target. In this work, we advocate predicting difference charge density (DCD) instead. We term this simple technique by $\\Delta$-SAED, which leverages the prior physical information of superposition of atomic electron densities (SAED). The robustness of $\\Delta$-SAED is demonstrated through evaluations over diverse benchmark datasets, showing an extra accuracy gain for more than 90% structures in the test sets. Using a Si allotropy dataset, $\\Delta$-SAED is demonstrated to advance model's transferability to chemical accuracy for non-self-consistent calculations. By incorporating physical priors to compensate for the limited expressive power of machine learning models, $\\Delta$-SAED offers a cost-free yet robust approach to improving charge density prediction and enhancing non-self-consistent performance.",

An application of the response functions of graphene to calculation of the equilibrium Casimir force between two graphene sheets and Casimir-Polder forces between an atom (nanoparticle) and a graphene sheet is considered with due attention to the role of a nonzero energy gap, chemical potential and a material substrate underlying the graphene sheet.

    "summary": "Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.",

    "summary": "The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric materials requires models that are both accurate and interpretable. Traditional machine learning approaches, while effective at property prediction, often act as black boxes and provide limited physical insight. In this work, we introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) for the prediction of thermoelectric properties, focusing on the Seebeck coefficient and band gap. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs achieve comparable predictive accuracy while offering explicit symbolic representations of structure--property relationships. This dual capability enables both reliable predictions and the extraction of physically meaningful functional forms. Benchmarking against literature models further highlights the robustness and generalisability of the approach. Our findings demonstrate that KANs provide a powerful framework for reverse engineering materials with targeted thermoelectric properties, bridging the gap between predictive performance and scientific interpretability.",

Our results demonstrate experimentally that the bimagnon excitation in Cu L-edge RIXS is enhanced if the incident x-ray energy is slightly above the absorption edge. Through incident-energy-dependent momentum-resolved RIXS, we investigated the excitation of the bimagnon with predominantly A1 symmetry. The bimagnons of La2CuO4 exhibit a nearly flat dispersion with momentum along the Cu-O bond direction. This observation agrees with the bimagnon dispersion from the calculations on a single-band Hubbard model rather than a Heisenberg model with only the nearest neighbor exchange interaction. This means that the effect of the higher-order spin couplings such as the cyclic or ring exchange interactions caused by the coherent motion of electrons beyond nearest-neighbor sites is important for understanding the bimagnon dynamics of cuprates.",

We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, and robust enforcement of boundary conditions.

The entanglement of dual $-$ localized and itinerant $-$ nature of electrons lies at the heart of the correlated electron systems giving rise to exotic ground state properties such as complex magnetism, heavy fermionic behavior, Kondo lattice formation, \\textit{etc}. Through temperature-dependent electronic structure of vdW ferromagnets, (Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$, probed using high-resolution photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), we provide direct evidence of the emergence of Kondo resonance peak driven by complex interplay between localized and itinerant electrons. In overall agreement with experimental electronic structure and magnetic properties, DFT+DMFT also reveals finite spin band splitting well beyond $T_{C}$. Core levels, valence band photoemission spectra together with DFT+DMFT spectral functions reveal insignificant change across $T_{C}$ indicating non-Stoner magnetism in (Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$. Our results provide a way forward to the understanding of complex interplay between electronic structure, exotic magnetism and heavy fermionic behavior leading to Kondo scenerio in 3$d$ vdW ferromagnets.",

    "summary": "The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.",

    "summary": "Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moire materials present a unique platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases beyond the paradigm of ideal quantum geometry. While analytical approaches to FCIs and fractional quantum Hall states (FQHS) often rely on idealized Bloch wavefunctions, realistic moire models lack direct tunability of quantum metric and Berry curvature, limiting theoretical and numerical exploration. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework to model interacting Hamiltonians directly through the distribution of single-particle form factors. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE), we show that unsupervised learning can not only distinguish FCI and non-FCI states, but also generate new form factors with distinct topological character, not present in the training set. This latent space enables the generation and interpolation of form factors for topological flatbands with Chern number $|C|=1$, enabling the discovery of unobserved many-body states such as charge density waves. Principal component analysis (PCA) further reveals that the dominant patterns in the form factors-reflecting correlations across the Brillouin zone-can be decomposed into components with approximately quantized Chern numbers, providing new insights into the global and topological structure of quantum geometry. Our results highlight the ability of machine learning to generalize and model topological quantum systems, paving the way for the inverse design of form factors with tailored quantum geometry and many-body phases in flatband materials.",

    "summary": "Altermagnets have zero net magnetization yet feature spin-split bands that host spin-polarized states. Here, we investigate how slow lattice vibrations (phonons) influence both the intrinsic and externally induced spin polarizations in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. For the induced spin polarizations, we employ a Rashba continuum model with electron-phonon coupling (EPC) treated at the static-Holstein level and analyze the spin Edelstein effect using the Kubo linear-response formalism. We find that moderate-to-strong EPC progressively suppresses the induced polarization via both intraband and interband channels, with a critical coupling marking the onset of complete spin Edelstein depolarization. The depolarization transition arises from a phonon-induced energy renormalization that pushes the spin-split bands anisotropically above the chemical potential, leading to a complete collapse of the Fermi surface. While (de)polarization can occur even in the Rashba non-altermagnetic phase, it remains isotropic. The presence of altermagnetism makes it anisotropic and breaks the conventional antisymmetry between spin susceptibilities that occurs with pure spin-orbit coupling, rendering the effect highly relevant for spintronic applications. We further investigate how the phonon coupling to the altermagnetic order, Rashba spin-orbit strength, and carrier doping collectively tune the depolarization transition. Our findings demonstrate that phonon scattering (e.g., through various substrates) offers a powerful means for on-demand control of spin polarization, enabling reversible switching between spin-polarized and depolarized states -- a key functionality for advancing spin logic architectures and optimizing next-generation spintronic devices.",

    "summary": "Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.",

Both methods avoid empirical Hubbard U parameters and are free from double-counting issues. CMRT employs a Gutzwiller-type approximation that enables efficient calculations, while GCGM goes beyond this approximation to achieve higher accuracy at higher computational cost. By benchmarking against available quantum Monte Carlo results, we demonstrate that while both methods are more accurate than the widely used density-functional theory (DFT), GCGM systematically captures additional correlation energy missing in CMRT, leading to significantly improved total energy predictions. We also show that by including the correlation energy $E_c$ from LDA in the CMRT calculation, CMRT+$E_c$ produces energy in better agreement with the QMC results in these hydrogen lattice systems.",

    "summary": "The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field, high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \\emph{in situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment, also imaged \\emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the sub-micron pixel scale.",

We also highlight the emerging use of SAW devices to probe adsorption desorption dynamics, offering analyte specific interaction signatures beyond equilibrium, offering a new perspective into analyte specific interaction pathways. Additionally, the integration of machine learning is discussed as a transformative tool for signal decoding, environmental compensation, and adaptive calibration. We also identify key challenges, cross sensitivity, signal drift, material degradation, and deployment at the edge and review recent strategies to address them.

We benchmark the Pauli Path simulation results against exact ground-state energies when available, and against density-matrix renormalization group calculations otherwise, finding strong agreement. To further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model. Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path simulation.

While such models have been constructed within Cartesian space to harness geometric information and preserve intuitive physical representations, they face inherent challenges - primarily due to the lack of a systematic symmetry-preserving framework for representing arbitrary physical tensors. We address these challenges by proposing Cartesian Natural Tensor Networks (CarNet) as a general framework for atomistic ML. We first develop the theory of irreducible representations using Cartesian natural tensors (their creation, operation, as well as the decomposition and reconstruction of physical tensors such as the elastic constant tensor). Leveraging this machinery, we design an equivariant Cartesian model and demonstrate its exceptional performance across diverse atomistic ML tasks. CarNet enables the development of highly accurate and reliable interatomic potentials for both materials and molecular systems. Furthermore, structure-property relationships can be readily constructed for tensorial quantities ranging from simple properties like the dipole moment to arbitrary high-rank tensors with complex symmetries such as the elastic constant tensor -- capabilities that were previously inaccessible. This work removes theoretical barriers and unleashes the power of Cartesian approaches for advanced atomistic ML in the understanding and design of new materials.",

By combining machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors, we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the aid of theoretical simulations.",

In this work, we consider the problem of bijectively embedding the vertices of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ into the leaves of an $n$-leaf rooted binary tree $\\mathcal{B}$. The congestion of such an embedding is given by the largest size of the cut induced by the two components obtained by deleting any vertex of $\\mathcal{B}$. The congestion $\\mathrm{cng}(G)$ is defined as the minimum congestion obtained by any embedding. We show that $\\lambda_2(G)\\cdot 2n/9\\le \\mathrm{cng} (G)\\le \\lambda_n(G)\\cdot 2n/9$, where $0=\\lambda_1(G)\\le \\cdots \\le \\lambda_n(G)$ are the Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$. We also provide a contraction heuristic given by hierarchically spectral clustering the original graph, which we numerically find to be effective in finding low congestion embeddings for sparse graphs. We numerically compare our congestion bounds on different families of graphs with regular structure (hypercubes and lattices), random graphs, and tensor network representations of quantum circuits. Our results imply lower and upper bounds on the memory complexity of tensor network contraction in terms of the underlying graph.",

    "summary": "The recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates offer a novel platform to explore an exotic pairing mechanism in multi-band systems towards high-temperature superconductivity and associated rich quantum phases, contrasting with cuprates. Here, we show that infinite-layer (La,Sr)NiO$_2$ exhibits strong-coupling superconductivity, resilient to in-plane magnetic fields exceeding 47 T at optimal doping - more than twice the Pauli limit for conventional BCS superconductors. This violation becomes pronounced towards the underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties - specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients - coincide with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength. This demonstrates a definitive link between electron correlations and strong-coupling superconductivity in (La,Sr)NiO$_2$, contributing to a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity.",

In this work, we benchmark the MACE machine learning model against a well-trained DeePMD potential for predicting interstitial lithium diffusivity in LiF, a key component in the solid electrolyte interphase in Li ion batteries. Our results demonstrate that the MACE-MPA-0 foundational model achieves comparable accuracy to well-trained DeePMD, in predicting key diffusion properties based on molecular dynamics simulation, while requiring minimal or no training data. For instance, the MACE-MPA-0 predicts an activation energy Ea of 0.22 eV, the fine-tuned model with only 300 data points predicts Ea = 0.20 eV, both of which show good agreement with the DeePMD model reference value of Ea = 0.24 eV. In this work, we provide a solid test case where fine-tuning approaches - whether using data generated for DeePMD or data produced by the foundational MACE model itself - yield similar robust performance to the DeePMD potential trained with over 40,000 actively learned data, albeit requiring only a fraction of the training data.",

Although the topological behaviors are broken because of the presence of modulations, we can still construct the modulated version of the symmetry TFT bulks by inserting a series of domain walls described by invertible bimodule categories.

In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, imposing the natural Grassmann-evenness constraint on the Clifford circuits significantly reduces the number of disentangling gates, from 720 to just 32, yielding a far more efficient implementation. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.",

This improvement stems from a more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our results against previous numerical studies.",

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.",

We also show that, due to its variational nature, DMRG provides an ideal tool to benchmark accuracy domains, as well as the performance of new hardware developments and related numerical libraries. Detailed numerical error analysis and performance assessment are also presented for subcomponents of the DMRG algebra by systematically interpolating between double- and pseudo-half-precision. Our analyis represents the first quantum chemistry evaluation of FP64 emulation for correlated calculations capable of achieving chemical accuracy and emulation based on fixed-point arithmetic, and it paves the way for the utilization of state-of-the-art Blackwell technology in tree-like tensor network state electronic structure calculations, opening new research directions in materials sciences and beyond.",

    "summary": "The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has aroused significant interest in exploring the pairing mechanism. Previous studies have proposed an effective d$_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital bilayer $t-J_{\\parallel}-J_{\\perp}$ model, in which the electrons of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are charge carriers, which are subject to the intralayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange $J_{\\parallel}$ and the large interlayer AFM superexchange $J_{\\perp}\\approx 2J_{\\parallel}$, with the latter transferred from the nearly half-filled and hence localized $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the strong Hund's rule coupling. Here we study this model by the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation and find a dominant interlayer s-wave pairing, in which the SC order parameters have a drastic improvement compared with those of the mean field (MF) type of theories. In real materials, the Hund's coupling is finite, leading to reduced $J_{\\perp}$, dictating that the MF-type theories have difficulty explaining the HTSC. However, our VMC calculations find that even for effective $J_{\\perp}$ as weak as $J_{\\perp}=J_{\\parallel}$, the interlayer pairing is still considerably large and can be compared with the $T_c$ observed in experiments, which is very weak in MF-type theories. This result indicates the important role of the Gutzwiller projection in improving the $T_c$, which is ignored in the MF-type theories. In addition, our results show that suppressed interlayer hopping can promote interlayer pairing, which is consistent with the fact that the interlayer hopping of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is very weak. Our research offers a new perspective for understanding the pairing mechanism of bilayer nickelates and provides a reference for recent ultra-cold atom experiments in mixed-dimensional systems.",

    "summary": "Aluminum is a widely used alloy, which is susceptible to fatigue failure. Characterizing fatigue performance for materials is extremely time and cost demanding, especially for high cycle data. To help mitigate this, a transfer learning based framework has been developed using Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) in which a source LSTM model is trained based on pure axial fatigue data for Aluminum 7075-T6 alloy which is then transferred to predict high cycle torsional S-N curves. The framework was able to accurately predict Al torsional S-N curves for a much higher cycle range. It is the belief that this framework will help to drastically mitigate the cost of gathering fatigue characteristics for different materials and help prioritize tests with better cost and time constraints.",

Our approach avoids encoding directly the original fermions into qubits and instead relies on reformulating the original model onto a system of fermions coupled to spins and then decoupling them in a self-consistent manner. We then introduce the auxiliary spin solver: this hybrid quantum-classical algorithm handles a free-fermion problem, which can be solved efficiently with a few classical resources, and an interacting spin problem, which can be naturally encoded in the analog quantum computer. This algorithm can be used to study both the equilibrium Mott transition as well as non-equilibrium properties of the original Fermi-Hubbard model, highlighting the potential of quantum-classical hybrid approaches to study strongly correlated matter.",

Motivated by recent theoretical proposals linking such response patterns to the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, we numerically analyze the real-time dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality using the time-evolving block decimation algorithm. We find that sharply localized and periodically recurring responses emerge only for specific types of perturbations, namely those that correspond to local density fields in the continuum limit. In contrast, perturbations involving other spin components produce conventional propagating excitations without localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the response remains qualitatively robust when the time-dependent perturbation is approximated by a piecewise-linear function, highlighting the practical relevance of our findings for quantum simulation platforms with limited temporal resolution. Our results clarify the operator dependence of emergent bulk-like dynamics in critical spin chains and offer guidance for probing holographic physics in experimental settings.",

On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a 120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order becomes unstable to a spin spiral.

Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we chart the quantum phase diagram and reveal the boundary criticalities encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Additionally, using renormalization group analysis, we compute the boundary critical exponent up to two loops. Remarkably, the simulations and two-loop renormalization group calculations consistently demonstrate that the presence of the boundary Majorana fermion at the special transition gives rise to a new type of boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa fixed point.

In the non-interacting limit, we find that, at half-filling, the system exhibits robust topological behavior if the inter-leg hopping is allowed. Though depending on the dimerization pattern, the dimerized leg can be either topological or trivial in nature, here we show that by connecting such a leg to a uniform leg through inter-chain coupling, the overall system becomes topological irrespective of the dimerization pattern in the dimerized leg. As a result, a topological phase transition occurs as a function of the inter-leg hopping. When the inter-leg interaction is turned on, the topological phase survives, and we obtain an interaction induced topological phase transition. Finally, we reveal that when uniform interactions are included on all the bonds of the ladder, the topological phase transitions to a symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) phase.",

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture reorganization at finite temperature.",

    "summary": "Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets, yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature. Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing, microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level (independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1 scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0% (feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49 to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes, enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.",

    "summary": "Spintronics offers a promising approach to energy efficient neuromorphic computing by integrating the functionalities of synapses and neurons within a single platform. A major challenge, however, is achieving field-free spin orbit torque SOT control over both synaptic and neuronal devices using an industry-adopted spintronic materials stack. In this study, we present field-free SOT spintronic synapses utilizing a CoFeB ferromagnetic thin film system, where asymmetrical device design and specifically added lateral notches in the CoFeB thin film facilitate effective domain wall DW nucleation, movement, and pinning and depinning. This method yields multiple analog, nonvolatile resistance states with enhanced linearity and symmetry, resulting in programmable and stable synaptic weights. We provide a systematic measurement approach to improve the linearity and symmetry of the synapses. Additionally, we demonstrate nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions MTJs that function as SOT-driven stochastic neurons, exhibiting current-tunable, Boltzmann-like probabilistic switching behavior, which provides an intrinsic in-hardware Gibbs sampling capability. By integrating these synapses and neurons into a Boltzmann machine complemented by a classifier layer, we achieve recognition accuracies greater than 98 percent on the MNIST dataset and 86 percent on Fashion MNIST. This work establishes a framework for field free synaptic and neuronal devices, setting the stage for practical, materials-compatible, and all spintronic neuromorphic computing hardware.",

Using the MLIP, we perform heating-cooling simulations of doped-MoS2 supercells. The simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides an open-source computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance. The MLIP bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap between first-principles methods and empirical potentials, and the framework offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale materials discovery in two-dimensional doped material systems.",

Scattering experiments are central to verifying the atomic structures of autonomously synthesised materials. Yet, interpreting these measurements typically requires user expertise and manual processing, or machine learning (ML) models trained on predefined datasets, limiting fully autonomous materials discovery. Here, we introduce a differentiable optimisation framework that treats scattering calculations, energetics, and chemical constraints as a unified refinement problem. Capability demonstrations across molecules, crystal structures, nanoparticles, and amorphous matter show that this data-driven approach resolves structural degeneracies with multi-modal inputs - suggesting its usefulness for informing, and ultimately guiding, the operation of autonomous laboratories.",

Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we discover two successive commensurate-incommensurate transitions of the non-conformal Pokrovsky-Talapov universality class, occurring (even) at zero magnetic field. The first transition marks the condensation of bound pairs of magnons into a critical phase with central charge $c=2$, emerging from a gapped period-4 phase. At the second transition, an incommensurate quadrupolar (or nematic) Luttinger liquid forms out of a gapped phase separation state, via the pairwise condensation of domain walls. We argue that both transitions involve the same underlying incommensurate nematic Luttinger liquid, and that the $c=2$ phase can be understood as a coexistence of a conventional (single-magnon type) and quadrupolar (two-magnon type) Luttinger liquids. Our results demonstrate that frustration alone is sufficient to drive continuous commensurate-incommensurate transitions of Mott type and stabilise incommensurate quasi-long-range order without doping.",

    "summary": "SrCuO2 has long been considered a near-archetypal realization of a quasi one dimensional (1D) system of interacting electrons with short-range interactions. Within this framework, experimental observations - interpreted through the lens of the 1D Hubbard model-suggest that electron and hole excitations decay into two types of (unphysical) collective bosonic modes: spinons, which carry the spin degree of freedom, and holons, which carry the charge degree of freedom. This model, known as spin-charge separation, is most directly evidenced by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), where a photo-induced hole decays into a continuum of these excitations. Here we present an alternative perspective grounded in first-principles, self-consistent, and parameter-free many-body perturbation theory. In this revised quasiparticle framework, ARPES can be understood as a one-body effect arising from mild disorder in a long-range antiferromagnetic ground state. the emergence of the so-called spinon branch arises naturally from spin disorder, the anomalous line widths are accurately captured, and we provide a compelling explanation for the spectral weight observed at the non-magnetic zone boundary. This reinterpretation provides a unified explanation for key experimental signatures previously attributed to spin-charge separation, including features observed in optical conductivity. Additionally, we show that SrCuO2 exhibits a nontrivial interchain coupling that significantly influences both its one-particle and two-particle spectral functions. By comparing the spectral features of SrCuO2 with those of La2CuO4, we argue that SrCuO2 shares notable similarities with the two-dimensional cuprates - both being rooted in a common CuO4 plaquette-based molecular orbital framework.",

This deep connection to quantum computing naturally motivates the realization and study of topologically ordered quantum states on quantum processors.

The MPS tensors are mapped to unitary gates, which are subsequently decomposed into native gates on quantum hardware. States with periodic boundary conditions (pbc) can be represented efficiently as quantum circuits using ancilla qubits and post-selection after measurement. We derive an exact expression for the success rate of this probabilistic approach, which can be evaluated a priori. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in two examples. First, we prepare the ground state of the Heisenberg model with pbc and simulate dynamics under a quenched Hamiltonian. The volume-law entanglement growth in the time evolution challenges classical algorithms but can potentially be overcome on quantum hardware. Second, we construct quantum circuits that generate excited states of the Schwinger model with high fidelities. Our approach provides a scalable method for preparing states on a quantum device, enabling efficient simulations of strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum computers.",

    "summary": "Interfacing light with quantum systems is an integral part of quantum technology, with the most essential building block being single-photon emitters. Although various platforms exist, each with its individual strengths, molecular emitters boast a unique advantage -- namely the flexibility to tailor their design to fit the requirements of a specific task. However, the characteristics of the vast space of possible molecular configurations are challenging to understand and explore. Here, we present a theoretical and computational framework to initiate exploration of this vast potential by integrating database analysis with microscopic predictions. Using a model system of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene host as benchmark, our approach identifies promising new candidates, among them a chiral molecular emitter. Future extensions of our approach integrated with machine learning routines hold the promise of ultimately unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum light-matter interfaces.",

    "summary": "The thermal Hall effect has been observed in a wide variety of magnetic insulators, yet its origin remains controversial. While some studies attribute it to intrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers with Berry curvature -- others propose extrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers scattering off crystal defects. Even the nature of the heat carriers is unknown: magnons, phonons, and fractionalized spin excitations have all been proposed. These questions are significant for the study of quantum spin liquids and are particularly relevant for $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, where a quantized thermal Hall effect has been attributed to Majorana edge modes. Here, we use ultrasonic measurements of the acoustic Faraday effect to demonstrate that the phonons in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have Hall viscosity -- a non-dissipative viscosity that rotates phonon polarizations and deflects phonon heat currents. We show that phonon Hall viscosity produces an intrinsic thermal Hall effect that quantitatively accounts for a significant fraction of the measured thermal Hall effect in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, we demonstrate that the acoustic Faraday effect is a powerful tool for detecting phonon Hall viscosity and the associated phonon Berry curvature, offering a new way to uncover and study exotic states of matter that elude conventional experiments.",

It relies on projecting resolvents to the tangent space of the GS-MPS, where they can be efficiently represented using Krylov space techniques. This allows for a direct computation of spectral weights and their corresponding positions on the real-frequency axis. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the TaSK approach by showcasing spectral data for various models. These include the 1D Haldane-Shastry and Heisenberg models as benchmarks. As an interesting application, we study the Hubbard model on a cylinder at half-filling, augmented by a density-assisted hopping (DAH) term. We find that DAH leads to particle-hole asymmetric single-particle mobilities and lifetimes in the resulting Mott insulator, and identify the responsible scattering processes. Further, we find that DAH influences the dispersion of Green's function zeros beyond its range, which has a frustrating effect on the Mott insulator studied here.",

    "summary": "The development of next-generation structural materials for harsh environments requires rapid assessment of mechanical performance and its dependence on microstructure. While full-field crystal plasticity (CP) models provide detailed insights, the high computational cost limits their use with uncertainty quantification workflows and in component-scale simulation. Surrogate models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown promise in reproducing history-dependent mechanical behaviour but are applied to models with either fixed microstructure or representative volume elements. Here, we develop a microstructure sensitive RNN surrogate that predicts homogenised stress responses directly from three-dimensional grain structures and arbitrary deformation histories. The architecture employs a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with mappings from microstructure to both the initial hidden state and sequence inputs, allowing the model to capture path dependence and microstructure variability. Training data comprised of over 300,000 CP simulations generated using combinations of randomly generated microstructures and loading paths. The model was found to reproduce CP predictions for both in-distribution validation data and unseen deformation modes, with errors of 2 MPa to 3 MPa. Out-of-distribution microstructures were more difficult to predict, emphasising the need for representative training data with, for example, heavily textured microstructures. Embedding the model into a multiscale framework demonstrates its ability to replace conventional constitutive updates, reducing computational cost while preserving key features of the stress distribution. These results establish microstructure-informed RNN surrogates as a promising alternative to direct CP simulations, offering a pathway toward rapid multiscale modelling and uncertainty quantification.",

To accurately capture defect dynamics, twenty-one defect types have been included in the dataset. TGAP captures the experimentally observed decomposition of carbon atoms in the liquid phase at atmospheric pressure, while also accurately reproducing the radial distribution function of the high-temperature homogeneous liquid phase across a range of densities. Moreover, it predicts the melting point in very good agreement with density functional theory and experiments. The potential is equipped with the Nordlund-Lehtola-Hobler repulsive potential to capture the high repulsion of recoils in the collision cascades.

The proposed method, called the Quantum Fusion Layer (QFL), replaces classical fusion schemes with a hybrid quantum-classical procedure that uses parameterized quantum circuits to learn entangled feature interactions without requiring exponential parameter growth. Supported by quantum signal processing principles, the quantum component efficiently represents high-order polynomial interactions across modalities with linear parameter scaling, and we provide a separation example between QFL and low-rank tensor-based methods that highlights potential quantum query advantages. In simulation, QFL consistently outperforms strong classical baselines on small but diverse multimodal tasks, with particularly marked improvements in high-modality regimes. These results suggest that QFL offers a fundamentally new and scalable approach to multimodal fusion that merits deeper exploration on larger systems.",

    "summary": "The minimum weight matching (MWM) and maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) are two widely used and distinct decoding strategies for quantum error correction. For a given syndrome, the MWM decoder finds the most probable physical error corresponding to the MWM of the decoding graph, whereas MLD aims to find the most probable logical error. Although MLD is the optimal error correction strategy, it is typically more computationally expensive compared to the MWM decoder. In this work, we introduce an algorithm that approximates MLD with $K$ MWMs from the decoding graph. Taking the surface code subject to graphlike errors as an example, we show that it is possible to efficiently find the first $K$ MWMs by systematically modifying the original decoding graph followed by finding the MWMs of the modified graphs. For the case where the $X$ and $Z$ errors are correlated, despite the MWM of the decoding hypergraph cannot be found efficiently, we present a heuristic approach to approximate the MLD by finding the $K$ MWMs in the $X$ and $Z$ subgraphs. We benchmark the efficacy of our algorithm for the surface code subject to graphlike errors, the surface-square Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code and surface-hexagonal GKP code subject to the Gaussian random displacement errors, showing that the fidelity approaches that of the exact MLD (for the first two cases) or the tensor-network decoder (for the last case) as $K$ increases.",

    "summary": "A bottleneck for analyzing the interplay between magic and entanglement is the computation of these quantities in highly entangled quantum many-body magic states. Efficient extraction of entanglement can also inform our understanding of dynamical quantum processes such as measurement-induced phase transition and approximate unitary designs. We develop an efficient classical algorithm to compute the von Neumann entropy and entanglement spectrum for such states under the condition that they have low stabilizer nullity. The algorithm exploits the property of stabilizer codes to separate entanglement into two pieces: one generated by the common stabilizer group and the other from the logical state. The low-nullity constraint ensures both pieces can be computed efficiently. Our algorithm can be applied to study the entanglement in sparsely $T$-doped circuits with possible Pauli measurements as well as certain classes of states that have both high entanglement and magic. Combining with stabilizer learning subroutines, it also enables the efficient learning of von Neumann entropies for low-nullity states prepared on quantum devices.",

    "summary": "We study the classical simulability of noisy random quantum circuits under general noise models. While various classical algorithms for simulating noisy random circuits have been proposed, many of them rely on the anticoncentration property, which can fail when the circuit depth is small or under realistic noise models. We propose a new approach based on the exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), a measure of tripartite correlations. We prove that exponential CMI decay enables a classical algorithm to sample from noisy random circuits -- in polynomial time for one dimension and quasi-polynomial time for higher dimensions -- even when anticoncentration breaks down. To this end, we show that exponential CMI decay makes the circuit depth effectively shallow, and it enables efficient classical simulation for sampling. We further provide extensive numerical evidence that exponential CMI decay is a universal feature of noisy random circuits across a wide range of noise models. Our results establish CMI decay, rather than anticoncentration, as the fundamental criterion for classical simulability, and delineate the boundary of quantum advantage in noisy devices.",

This study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate established techniques including nondimensionalization for training stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, robust enforcement of boundary conditions and hybrid training with sparse data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINNs, achieving sub $1\\%$ relative error as compared to Finite Element Benchmarks with the hybrid model. Thereby showing that PINNs can be used for high fidelity electrochemical simulations with minimal data requirements and highlight necesary factors for fully autonomous PINN simulations.",

Existing state-of-the-art methods, notably tensor network approaches, have computational costs governed by the treewidth of the underlying circuit graph, making circuits with large treewidth intractable. This work rigorously analyzes FeynmanDD, a decision diagram-based simulation method proposed in CAV 2025 by a subset of the authors, and shows that the size of the multi-terminal decision diagram used in FeynmanDD is exponential in the linear rank-width of the circuit graph. As linear rank-width can be substantially smaller than treewidth and is at most larger than the treewidth by a logarithmic factor, our analysis demonstrates that FeynmanDD outperforms all tensor network-based methods for certain circuit families. We also show that the method remains efficient if we use the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm to expand arbitrary single-qubit gates to sequences of Hadamard and T gates, essentially removing the gate-set restriction posed by the method.",

    "summary": "Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids (QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\\em closed} quantum systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications, candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\\em open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.",

    "summary": "UO2 doped with parts per million Cr2O3 powder is considered a potential near term accident tolerant fuel candidate. Here, the results of decades of industry and academic research into Cr-doped UO2 are analyzed and their shortcomings are critiqued. Focusing on the incorporation mechanisms of Cr into the fuel matrix, we explore a mechanistic understanding of the characteristic properties of Cr-doped UO2, notably, enhanced fission gas retention attributed to enlarged grain sizes following sintering, along with marginal improvements in the thermophysical properties. The findings of recent X-ray Adsorption Near Edge Spectroscopy studies were compared and put into conversation with historic data regarding the incorporation of Cr in UO2. On the basis of defect mechanisms, the case is made for the substitutional incorporation of Cr governing the lattice solubility but not the enhanced U diffusivity. Instead, Cr/Cr2O3 redox chemistry in a well-defined oxygen potential explains the differences in the U diffusivity and O/M ratio. The primary mechanism of doping-enhanced grain growth is found to be liquid assisted sintering due to a CrO(l) eutectic phase at the grain boundaries. The role of inhomogeneities in Cr concentration in UO2 at various length scales across the materials microstructure is highlighted and connected to promising experimental and modeling work to fill in the gaps in the current understanding of Cr-doped UO2. The review ends with an outline of future works that combine meticulous irradiation studies and high resolution experiments with next generation modeling and simulations techniques empowered by machine learning advances to accelerate the fabrication and adoption of Cr-doped UO2 light water reactors.",

    "summary": "Far from equilibrium, neural systems self-organize across multiple scales. Exploiting multiscale self-organization in neuroscience and artificial intelligence requires a computational framework for modeling the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of stochastic neural trajectories. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics and representational geometry offer theoretical foundations, but we need scalable data-driven techniques for modeling collective properties of high-dimensional neural networks from partial subsampled observations. Renormalization is a coarse-graining technique central to studying emergent scaling properties of many-body and nonlinear dynamical systems. While widely applied in physics and machine learning, coarse-graining complex dynamical networks remains unsolved, affecting many computational sciences. Recent diffusion-based renormalization, inspired by quantum statistical mechanics, coarse-grains networks near entropy transitions marked by maximal changes in specific heat or information transmission. Here I explore diffusion-based renormalization of neural systems by generating symmetry-breaking representations across scales and offering scalable algorithms using tensor networks. Diffusion-guided renormalization bridges microscale and mesoscale dynamics of dissipative neural systems. For microscales, I developed a scalable graph inference algorithm for discovering community structure from subsampled neural activity. Using community-based node orderings, diffusion-guided renormalization generates renormalization group flow through metagraphs and joint probability functions. Towards mesoscales, diffusion-guided renormalization targets learning the effective non-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative neural trajectories occupying lower-dimensional subspaces, enabling coarse-to-fine control in systems neuroscience and artificial intelligence.",

    "summary": "We study the existence and limitations for hyperinvariant tensor networks incorporating a local SU(2) symmetry. As discrete implementations of the anti de-Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, such networks have created bridges between the fields of quantum information theory and quantum gravity. Adding SU(2) symmetry to the tensor network allows a direct connection to spin network states, a basis of the kinematic Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We consider a particular situation where the states can be interpreted as kinematic quantum states for three-dimensional quantum gravity. We show that important aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence are realized in certain quantum states of the gravitational field in LQG, thus justifying, from first principles, a class of models introduced by [F. Pastawski et al., JHEP 06, 149 (2015)]. We provide examples of hyperinvariant tensor networks, but also prove constraints on their existence in the form of no-go theorems that exclude absolutely maximally entangled states as well as general holographic codes from local SU(2)-invariance. We calculate surface areas as expectation values of the LQG area operator and discuss further possible constraints as a consequence of a decay of correlations on the boundary.",

    "summary": "We introduce the first randomized algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework for many quantum algorithms. Standard implementations of QSVT rely on block encodings of the Hamiltonian, which are costly to construct, requiring a logarithmic number of ancilla qubits, intricate multi-qubit control, and circuit depth scaling linearly with the number of Hamiltonian terms. In contrast, our algorithms use only a single ancilla qubit and entirely avoid block encodings. We develop two methods: (i) a direct randomization of QSVT, where block encodings are replaced by importance sampling, and (ii) an approach that integrates qDRIFT into the generalized quantum signal processing framework, with the dependence on precision exponentially improved through classical extrapolation. Both algorithms achieve gate complexity independent of the number of Hamiltonian terms, a hallmark of randomized methods, while incurring only quadratic dependence on the degree of the target polynomial. We identify natural parameter regimes where our methods outperform even standard QSVT, making them promising for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. We also establish a fundamental lower bound showing that the quadratic dependence on the polynomial degree is optimal within this framework. We apply our framework to two fundamental tasks: solving quantum linear systems and estimating ground-state properties of Hamiltonians, obtaining polynomial advantages over prior randomized algorithms. Finally, we benchmark our ground-state property estimation algorithm on electronic structure Hamiltonians and the transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions. In both cases, our approach outperforms prior work by several orders of magnitude in circuit depth, establishing randomized QSVT as a practical and resource-efficient alternative for early fault-tolerant quantum devices.",

    "summary": "The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$ superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap. Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital, demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\\pm$-wave pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.",

The first improvement involves refining the initial tensor. Specifically, we construct it using a quadrature method, which achieves higher accuracy compared to the conventional approach. The second improvement consists of analyzing the phase structure using the information of the conformal field theory, namely the central charge and the scaling dimensions, which can be accessed relatively easily via the tensor renormalization group method. Thanks to these improvements, we identify both the onset of the critical region, $\\beta_{\\rm c}=0.5952(8)$ and its universality class as the SU(2)${}_{k=1}$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.",

To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.",

    "summary": "Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende (ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase (110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics. Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics, with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable, exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase, dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.",

    "summary": "Utilizing the intrinsic history-dependence and nonlinearity of hardware, physical reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic approach to encode time-series data for in-sensor computing. The accuracy of this encoding critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally, we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost. Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the 4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical reservoir implementations across different material platforms.",

    "summary": "Understanding the entanglement structure of local Hamiltonian ground spaces is a physically motivated problem, with applications ranging from tensor network design to quantum error-correcting codes. To this end, we study the complexity of estimating ground state entanglement, and more generally entropy estimation for low energy states and Gibbs states. We find, in particular, that the classes qq-QAM [Kobayashi, le Gall, Nishimura, SICOMP 2019] (a quantum analogue of public-coin AM) and QMA(2) (QMA with unentangled proofs) play a crucial role for such problems, showing: (1) Detecting a high-entanglement ground state is qq-QAM-complete, (2) computing an additive error approximation to the Helmholtz free energy (equivalently, a multiplicative error approximation to the partition function) is in qq-QAM, (3) detecting a low-entanglement ground state is QMA(2)-hard, and (4) detecting low energy states which are close to product states can range from QMA-complete to QMA(2)-complete. Our results make progress on an open question of [Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset and Wocjan, Nature Physics 2022] on free energy, and yield the first QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem using local Hamiltonians (cf. the sparse QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012]).",

In particular, we use a Markov chain to efficiently sample measurements and contract the tensor network, propagating their effect forward along the spatial direction. Applications of our algorithm include validating quantum computers (capable of mid-circuit measurements) in regimes of easy classical simulability, and studying generative-machine-learning applications, where sampling from complex stochastic processes is the main task. As a demonstration of our algorithm, we consider a (1+1)-dimensional brickwall circuit of Haar-random unitaries, interspersed with generalized single-qubit measurements of variable strength. We simulate the dynamics for tens to hundreds of qubits if the circuit exhibits area-law entanglement (under strong measurements), and tens of qubits if it exhibits volume-law entanglement (under weak measurements). We observe signatures of a measurement-induced phase transition between the two regimes as a function of measurement strength.",

We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \\emph{effective dimension} and the \\emph{bias} of a model towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased, towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are relevant for the broader machine learning community.",

    "summary": "Calculating the quantum weight enumerator polynomial (WEP) is a valuable tool for characterizing quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes, but it is computationally hard for large or complex codes. The Quantum LEGO (QL) framework provides a tensor network approach for WEP calculation, in some cases offering superpolynomial speedups over brute-force methods, provided the code exhibits area law entanglement, that a good QL layout is used, and an efficient tensor network contraction schedule is found. We analyze the performance of a hyper-optimized contraction schedule framework across QL layouts for diverse stabilizer code families. We find that the intermediate tensors in the QL networks for stabilizer WEPs are often highly sparse, invalidating the dense-tensor assumption of standard cost functions. To address this, we introduce an exact, polynomial-time Sparse Stabilizer Tensor (SST) cost function based on the rank of the parity check matrices for intermediate tensors. The SST cost function correlates perfectly with the true contraction cost, providing a significant advantage over the default cost function, which exhibits large uncertainty. Optimizing contraction schedules using the SST cost function yields substantial performance gains, achieving up to orders of magnitude improvement in actual contraction cost compared to using the dense tensor cost function. Furthermore, the precise cost estimation from the SST function offers an efficient metric to decide whether the QL-based WEP calculation is computationally superior to brute force for a given QL layout. These results, enabled by PlanqTN, a new open-source QL implementation, validate hyper-optimized contraction as a crucial technique for leveraging the QL framework to explore the QEC code design space.",

Our setup naturally extends widely known Kronecker sum and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC models but admits richer interaction across modes. We suggest an iterative polynomial time algorithm based on TT-SVD and higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) adapted to Tucker-2 hybrid structure.

We explore this phase transition for Haar-random quantum codes, in which the logical information is encoded in a random subspace of the physical Hilbert space. We focus on the spectrum of the encoded system density matrix as a function of the rate of uncorrelated, single-qudit errors. For low error rates, this spectrum consists of well-separated bands, representing errors of different weights. As the error rate increases, the bands for high-weight errors merge. The evolution of these bands with increasing error rate is well described by a simple analytic ansatz. Using this ansatz, as well as an explicit calculation, we show that the threshold for Haar-random quantum codes saturates the hashing bound, and thus coincides with that for random \\emph{stabilizer} codes. For error rates that exceed the hashing bound, typical errors are uncorrectable, but postselected error correction remains possible until a much higher \\emph{detection} threshold. Postselection can in principle be implemented by projecting onto subspaces corresponding to low-weight errors, which remain correctable past the hashing bound.",

    "summary": "We introduce Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry (HDQI), a quantum algorithm that utilizes coherent Bell measurements and the symplectic representation of the Pauli group to reduce Gibbs sampling and Hamiltonian optimization to classical decoding. For a signed Pauli Hamiltonian $H$ and any degree-$\\ell$ polynomial ${P}$, HDQI prepares a purification of the density matrix $\\rho_{P}(H) \\propto {P}^2(H)$ by solving a combination of two tasks: decoding $\\ell$ errors on a classical code defined by $H$, and preparing a pilot state that encodes the anti-commutation structure of $H$. Choosing $P(x)$ to approximate $\\exp(-\\beta x/2)$ yields Gibbs states at inverse temperature $\\beta$; other choices prepare approximate ground states, microcanonical ensembles, and other spectral filters.   For local Hamiltonians, the corresponding decoding problem is that of LDPC codes. Preparing the pilot state is always efficient for commuting Hamiltonians, but highly non-trivial for non-commuting Hamiltonians. Nevertheless, we prove that this state admits an efficient matrix product state representation for Hamiltonians whose anti-commutation graph decomposes into connected components of logarithmic size.   We show that HDQI efficiently prepares Gibbs states at arbitrary temperatures for a class of physically motivated commuting Hamiltonians -- including the toric code and Haah's cubic code -- but we also develop a matching efficient classical algorithm for this task. For a non-commuting semiclassical spin glass and commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians with quantum defects, HDQI prepares Gibbs states up to a constant inverse-temperature threshold using polynomial quantum resources and quasi-polynomial classical pre-processing. These results position HDQI as a versatile algorithmic primitive and the first extension of Regev's reduction to non-abelian groups.",

Under natural conditions on the associated transfer operators, we prove the existence of thermodynamic limits of expectations of local observables and establish almost-sure exponential decay of two-point correlations. In the homogeneous (random translation-invariant) case, for any error tolerance in probability, the two-point function decays exponentially in the distance between the two sites, with a deterministic rate. In the i.i.d. case, the exponential decay still holds with a deterministic rate, with the probability approaching one exponentially fast in the distance. For strictly stationary ensembles with decaying spatial dependence, the correlation decay quantitatively reflects the mixing profile: ($\\rho$)-mixing yields polynomial bounds with high probability, while stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay in ($\\rho$) (resp. ($\\beta$)) yields stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay of the two-point function, again with correspondingly strong high-probability guarantees. Altogether, the framework unifies and extends recent progress on stationary ergodic and Gaussian translation-invariant ensembles, providing a transfer-operator route to typical correlation decay in random MPS.",

In this work, we study the problem of learning MPS in following setting: given many copies of an input MPS, the task is to recover a classical description of the state. The best known polynomial-time algorithm, introduced by [LCLP10, CPF+10], requires linear circuit depth and $O(n^5)$ samples, and has seen no improvement in over a decade. The strongest known lower bound is only $\\Omega(n)$. The combination of linear depth and high sample complexity renders existing algorithms impractical for near-term or even early fault-tolerant quantum devices.   We show a new efficient MPS learning algorithm that runs in $O(\\log n)$ depth and has sample complexity $O(n^3)$. Also, we can generalize our algorithm to learn closest MPS state, in which the input state is not guaranteed to be close to the MPS with a fixed bond dimension. Our algorithms also improve both sample complexity and circuit depth of previous known algorithm.",

    "summary": "Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems are prevalent in various applications and are known to be NP-hard. The seminal work of Goemans and Williamson introduced a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation for such problems, solvable in polynomial time that upper bounds the optimal value. Their approach also enables randomized rounding techniques to obtain feasible solutions with provable performance guarantees.   In this work, we identify instances of QUBO problems where matrix multiplicative weight methods lead to quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms that approximate the Goemans-Williamson SDP exponentially faster than existing methods, achieving polylogarithmic time complexity relative to the problem dimension. This speedup is attainable under the assumption that the QUBO cost matrix is sparse when expressed as a linear combination of Pauli strings satisfying certain algebraic constraints, and leverages efficient quantum and classical simulation results for quantum Gibbs states.   We demonstrate how to verify these conditions efficiently given the decomposition. Additionally, we explore heuristic methods for randomized rounding procedures and extract the energy of a feasible point of the QUBO in polylogarithmic time. While the practical relevance of instances where our methods excel remains to be fully established, we propose heuristic algorithms with broader applicability and identify Kronecker graphs as a promising class for applying our techniques. We conduct numerical experiments to benchmark our methods. Notably, by utilizing tensor network methods, we solve an SDP with $D = 2^{50}$ variables and extract a feasible point which is certifiably within $0.15\\%$ of the optimum of the QUBO through our approach on a desktop, reaching dimensions millions of times larger than those handled by existing SDP or QUBO solvers, whether heuristic or rigorous.",

The optimal deterministic approximation in each case is straightforward, and maximizes the fidelity: keep the largest entries or singular values. On the other hand, random mixtures of sparse states can achieve quadratically improved trace distances, and yield nontrivial bounds on other distance measures like the robustness. In this work, we give efficient algorithms for finding mixtures of sparse states that optimally approximate a given pure state in either trace distance or robustness. These algorithms also yield descriptions of efficiently samplable ensembles of sparse, or less-entangled, states that correspond to these optimal mixed approximations. This can be used for the truncation step of algorithms for matrix product states, improving their accuracy while using no extra memory, and we demonstrate this improvement numerically. Our proofs use basic facts about convex optimization and zero-sum games, as well as rigorous guarantees for computing maximum-entropy distributions.",

We analyze the role of locality in the coupling to the environment of the quantum system of interest, as we consider either local couplings throughout the system, or a single global coupling. We contrast the results obtained for two scenarios in which a chain of strongly interacting hardcore bosonic atoms is coupled directly to Markovian kinetic dissipative processes, or experiences effective dissipation through the mediation of the field of a lossy optical cavity. To investigate the dissipative dynamics of the many-body quantum systems considered we perform numerical simulations employing matrix product states numerical methods. We show that by coupling atomic tunneling terms to the global field of a dissipative cavity we can stabilize at long times both finite currents and current-current correlations throughout the atomic chain. This is in contrast to the setup in which dissipation acts directly via local tunneling processes, where currents arise in a small portion of the system and the current-current correlations are rapidly decaying.",

Determining the scale bars is an important first step of accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii) information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.",

We find a macroscopically degenerate mode in the spinon spectrum. It originates from the destructive interference due to the interaction with surrounding gauge fields, a form of many-body caging.

The derivation is carried out within the Unifying Nonequilibrium Perturbative Theory (UNEPT), which applies to both standard reservoir geometries and configurations with one or two quantum point contacts (QPCs) injecting dilute anyonic fluxes. Based on this FDT, we propose complementary methods to determine the time-domain braiding phase. The first method relates the DC backscattering noise to the integral of the current with respect to DC drives, while the second connects the AC current phase shift to the DC noise. The latter provides a particularly robust probe of the statistical angle $\\theta$, offering an intrinsic calibration and cancelling certain nonuniversal renormalization effects. Specializing to a thermalized Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL), we further show that in the quantum regime the phase shift enables a direct determination of the scaling dimension $\\delta$ when $\\delta > 1/2$. These results define experimentally accessible schemes to extract either $\\theta$ or $\\delta$ in minimal single-QPC setups, without relying on interferometry or cross-correlation measurements.",

These arrays provide the large lumped inductances required for qubit designs, yet their intrinsically many-body nature is typically reduced to effective single-mode descriptions. Perturbative treatments attempt to include the collective array modes neglected in these approximations, but a fully nonperturbative analysis is challenging due to the many-body structure and the collective character of these modes. We overcome this difficulty using the DMRG-X algorithm, which extends tensor-network methods to excited states. Our key advance is a construction of trial states from the linearized mode structure, enabling direct computation of excitations, even in degenerate manifolds, which was previously inaccessible. Our results reveal significant deviations from, and allow us to improve upon, previous perturbative treatments in the regime of low array junction impedance.",

In this work, we introduce a universal and exact representation of continuous antisymmetric functions by lifting them to continuous symmetric functions defined on an enlarged space. Building on this lifting, we obtain a \\emph{parity-graded representation} of fermionic wavefunctions, expressed in terms of symmetric feature variables that encode particle configuration and antisymmetric feature variables that encode exchange statistics. This representation is both exact and minimal: the number of required features scales as $D\\sim N^d$ ($d$ is spatial dimension) or $D\\sim N$ depending on the symmetric feature maps employed. Our results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for efficient representations of fermionic wavefunctions and enable scalable and systematically improvable neural network solvers for many-electron systems.",

    "summary": "The Anderson impurity model (AIM) is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics to study strongly correlated effects. However, accurately solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically determined by the bond dimension $\\chi$ of the temporal MPS. In this work, we propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function in the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions, can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each with bond dimension $2$. Our method gives a worst case scaling of $\\chi$ as $2^{8n}$ and $2^{2n}$ for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral functions, where we show that the actually required $\\chi$s are much smaller than the worst case.",

We also test different symmetrization strategies, finding that output averaging yields the lowest energies, though it becomes costly for larger system sizes. On cylindrical systems, we consistently observe filled stripes. On the torus, our calculations display features consistent with a doped Mott insulator, including antiferromagnetic correlations and suppressed density fluctuations.

    "summary": "Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts. These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation tools for reactive materials.",

    "summary": "Ultrasonic wave propagation across material surfaces reveals essential information about the materials' elastic behavior. The elastodynamic response of the surface is characterized by the Green's function that fully captures all its direction-dependent and frequency-dependent features. Here we present the first direct experimental visualization of the Green's function, including all its complex details resulting from elastic anisotropy. We achieve this visualization using a dedicated modification of transient grating spectroscopy (TGS), which is a method otherwise well established for measuring Rayleigh-type surface acoustic waves. To overcome the limitations of conventional TGS, we explore near-field thermoacoustic phenomena occurring within TGS experiments. We reveal that, along with the transient standing-wave patterns that diminish within hundreds of nanoseconds, there also emerge ultra-transient oscillations with lifetimes at least an order of magnitude shorter. These ultra-transient effects enable capturing the surface acoustic response with exceptional detail, and the resulting experimental angular dispersion maps strikingly replicate the theoretical Green's functions. By utilizing this feature, ultra-transient grating spectroscopy (UTGS) becomes a powerful new tool for detailed contactless characterization of anisotropic solids, opening new pathways for studying single-crystalline materials utilized in diverse modern application fields, including solid-state cooling via the elastocaloric effect, magnetoelastic devices, or nanoscale electromechanical systems.",

Local symmetries, described by gauge theories, are central to phenomena such as superconductivity, topological phases, and the Standard Model of particle physics. Emerging simulation techniques using tensor network states or quantum computers offer exciting new possibilities of exploring the physics of these gauge theories, but require careful implementation of gauge symmetry and charge-neutrality constraints. This is especially challenging for non-Abelian gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which governs the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. In a recent article (arXiv:2501.00579), we introduced \"charge-singlet measurements\" for quantum simulations, consisting of a projection based technique from group representation theory that allowed us to probe for the first time the phase diagram of (1+1)-dimensional QCD on a quantum computer. In this article, we show more broadly how to apply charge-singlet measurements as a flexible tool for both classical and quantum simulations of discrete and continuous gauge theories. Our approach extends the use of charge-singlet measurements beyond state preparation in the charge neutral (charge-singlet) sector to include noise mitigation in symmetry-preserving time-evolution circuits. We further demonstrate how this method enables the computation of thermodynamic observables$\\unicode{x2014}$such as entropy$\\unicode{x2014}$within the charge-singlet subspace, providing a new tool for exploring the connection between quantum thermodynamics and gauge symmetry.",

    "summary": "This article explores the deep interconnections among three seemingly unrelated concepts in condensed matter physics: electronic liquid crystal phases, multipole expansions, and altermagnetism. At the heart of these phenomena lies a shared foundation: spin-momentum locking in the nonrelativistic regime. Originally proposed in the context of electronic liquid crystal phases, spin-momentum locking was later elegantly incorporated into the formalism of multipole expansions. This framework can be further extended across multiple atomic sites, making it particularly effective for describing altermagnets, which feature localized magnetic moments distributed over at least two sublattices. In the second part of the article, we examine superconducting phenomena that stem from this shared mechanism, focusing on superconductivity in systems with spin-momentum locked Fermi surfaces. We highlight a rich variety of unconventional superconducting states, including finite-momentum pairing, $d$-wave and spin-triplet superconductivity, and topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, among others. Additional related topics are addressed in the concluding section. Overall, this work offers both an accessible introduction to the newly identified magnetic order known as altermagnetism and a conceptual guide for researchers aiming to harness the ensuing unconventional superconductivity in the development of future quantum technologies.",

A microscopic understanding of excitons in such non-Hermitian settings demands a first-principles generalization of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Building on a recently introduced nonequilibrium Green's function formalism compatible with Lindbladian dynamics, we derive a non-Hermitian BSE from diagrammatic perturbation theory on the Keldysh contour, and obtain a microscopic excitonic Hamiltonian that incorporates dissipation while preserving causality. We apply the formalism to valley excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides coupled to structured photon baths. We uncover a rich landscape of exceptional points in momentum space, forming either discrete sets or continuous manifolds, depending on bath structure. The exceptional points give rise to nonanalytic valley-polarization, unusual polarization pattern in photoluminescence, and nontrivial topological signatures. Our results establish a first-principles framework for predicting and controlling excitonic behavior in open quantum materials, showing how engineered environments can be leveraged to induce and manipulate non-Hermitian and topological properties.",

In two dimensions we use the singular value decomposition and in three dimensions we use tensor trains to compress the numerical solution. To control rank growth we use step-truncation during time stepping and a low-rank Anderson acceleration for the WaveHoltz fixed point iteration. We have carried out extensive numerical experiments demonstrating the convergence and efficacy of the iterative scheme for free- and half-space problems in two and three dimensions with constant and piecewise constant wave speeds.",

    "summary": "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores, chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values. Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.",

Applied to the recently developed Alexandria materials database, containing over four hundred thousand insulating materials, we uncover a clear elemental trend, with vanadium emerging as a strong indicator of materials with high-spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME). In particular, vanadium-based perovskite materials show a substantially higher fraction of high-SLME compounds compared to the database average, underscoring their promise for optoelectronic applications.",

We show analytically that the density-assisted hopping induces an attractive interaction in the lower (bonding) band of the dimer structure and a repulsion in the upper (anti-bonding) band. Overcoming the onsite repulsion, this can lead to the appearance of superconductivity. The superconductivity depends strongly on the filling, and present a pairing structure more complex than s-wave pairing. Combining numerical and analytical methods such as the matrix product states ansatz, bosonization and perturbative calculations we map out the phase diagram of the two-leg ladder system and identify its superconducting phase. We characterize the transition from the non-density-assisted repulsive regime to the spin-gapped superconducting regime as a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.",

    "summary": "Accurate yet transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for accelerating materials and chemical discovery. However, most universal MLIPs overfit to narrow datasets or computational protocols, limiting their reliability across chemical and functional domains. We introduce a transferable multi-domain training strategy that jointly optimizes universal and task-specific parameters through selective regularization, coupled with a domain-bridging set (DBS) that aligns potential-energy surfaces across datasets. Systematic ablation experiments show that small DBS fractions (0.1%) and targeted regularization synergistically enhance out-of-distribution generalization while preserving in-domain fidelity. Trained on fifteen open databases spanning molecules, crystals, and surfaces, our model, SevenNet-Omni, achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy, including adsorption-energy errors below 0.06 eV on metallic surfaces and 0.1 eV on metal-organic frameworks. Despite containing only 0.5% r$^2$SCAN data, SevenNet-Omni reproduces high-fidelity r$^2$SCAN energetics, demonstrating effective cross-functional transfer from large PBE datasets. This framework offers a scalable route toward universal, transferable MLIPs that bridge quantum-mechanical fidelities and chemical domains.",

    "summary": "This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven methodology for predicting a combination of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials. Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms are compared with the deep learning (DL) model. The developed models are tested using k-fold validation. Nine different input-output feature configurations are evaluated to assess the model performance. The input-output feature comprises material properties, namely, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and molecular mass of brazed ceramic-metal composite materials obtained from literature and the strength parameter (average Von Mises Stress (VMS)) estimated from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation for joint assembly structure. A multi-output model, Autoencoder (AE), has also been developed and tested to predict various features. The ML model, namely the polynomial regression (PR), outperforms the other ML/DL models with a Mean square Error (MSE) of 0.01 for the test data. The autoencoder model with a 32-16-32 structure outperforms LR, PR, RF, and ANN with an MSE of 0.04% for the prediction of unseen data. The developed multi-output model accurately predicts all the features (single and multiple), while PR fails to accurately predict multi-output features of low importance. The developed AE model predicts the different material properties with an average error of ~0.16-3.78% with literature-reported values.",

    "summary": "The kagome lattice of spin-1/2 Cu atoms in herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2) may sustain a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state with spinon quasiparticles. Each kagome plane is separated from its homologues by a layer of spinless Zn atoms. Providentially, however, some spin-1/2 Cu atoms substitute randomly onto these inter-kagome Zn sites. We reconceptualize these 'impurity' atoms as quantum 'witness-spins', an exceptional new interrogative of the conjectured Z2-gauge-symmetric QSL state. Thus we introduce spin-noise spectroscopy to explore herbertsmithite witness-spin dynamics for QSL studies. It reveals the existence, slowing and intensification of spin noise, prefatory to a sharp transition at T* {\\approx} 260 mK. Below T* the spin-noise power spectral density S_M({\\omega},T) {\\propto} {\\omega}^{-{\\alpha}(T)} stabilizes at {\\alpha} {\\approx} 1; the spin noise variance {\\sigma}_M^2(T) diminishes precipitously; the ultra-low-field magnetic susceptibility {\\chi}(T) undergoes a sharp transition into a phase exhibiting an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter and ultra-slow spin-state relaxation. A Z2 QSL theory of spinon-mediated witness-spin interactions corresponds best to all these experimental observations, predicting slowing and intensification of witness-spin fluctuations and noise spectrum S_M({\\omega},T) with cooling, with a transition into a unique spinon-mediated phase signified by rapidly diminishing spin noise, with S_M({\\omega},T) {\\propto} {\\omega}^{-1}, a sharp cusp in the DC magnetic susceptibility {\\chi}(T), and the appearance of an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter. We rule out numerous other mechanisms for these effects, so that only spinon-mediation by either a Z2 or U(1) QSL is consistent with all present herbertsmithite empirics, with the former model providing a closer match to data.",

The deterministic preparation of entangled states is one of the key factors for realization of quantum networks.

Here, we theoretically analysize under what conditions entangled states can be prepared in three kinds of basic Gaussian quantum networks, named triangle networks, star-shaped networks and chain-type networks. Some necessity criteria are derived for all preparable entangled Gaussian states in such networks. It shows that the network structure imposes strong constraints on the set of preparable entangled Gaussian states, which is fundamentally different with the standard single multipartite entanglement. This takes the first step towards understanding network mechanism for preparing entangled Gaussian states.",

To address this, we introduce two emulators, emu-sv and emu-mps, as computational backends for Pasqal's pulser package. Emu-sv is designed for high-precision state-vector simulations, giving the possibility to emulate systems of up to $\\thicksim 27$ qubits on an A100 40GB GPU, making it perfect for cases where numerically exact results are needed. In contrast, emu-mps uses a Matrix Product State representation and other controlled approximations to efficiently simulate much larger arrays of atoms with manageable errors. We show through benchmark comparisons that both emulators provide significant speed-ups over generic solvers such as QuTiP. In addition, we provide practical guidance on choosing between the two emulators. These quantum software tools are designed to support researchers and developers aiming to simulate quantum systems either as a precursor to full hardware implementation or as a means of benchmarking hardware performance.",

These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switche the N\\'eel vector.

Extending the Tensor Jump Method, which combines TDVP-based tensor-network evolution with a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of stochastic trajectories, our approach incorporates time-dependent decay rates-treating positive rates as time-inhomogeneous Markovian processes and negative rates via the Influence Martingale formalism to unravel time-local non-Markovian dynamics.

    "summary": "Neuromorphic computing hardware enables edge computing and can be implemented in flexible electronics for novel applications. Metal oxide materials are promising candidates for fabricating flexible neuromorphic electronics, but suffer from processing constraints due to the incompatibilities between oxides and polymer substrates. In this work, we use photonic curing to fabricate flexible metal-insulator-metal capacitors with solution-processible aluminum oxide dielectric tailored for neuromorphic applications. Because photonic curing outcomes depend on many input parameters, identifying an optimal processing condition through a traditional grid-search approach is unfeasible. Here, we apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to determine photonic curing conditions that optimize the trade-off between desired electrical properties of large capacitance-frequency dispersion and low leakage current. Furthermore, we develop a human-in-the-loop (HITL) framework for incorporating failed experiments into the MOBO machine learning workflow, demonstrating that this framework accelerates optimization by reducing the number of experimental rounds required. Once optimization is concluded, we analyze different Pareto-optimal conditions to tune the dielectrics properties and provide insight into the importance of different inputs through Shapley Additive exPlanations analysis. The demonstrated framework of combining MOBO with HITL feedback can be adapted to a wide range of multi-objective experimental problems that have interconnected inputs and high experimental failure rates to generate usable results for machine learning models.",

    "summary": "Altermagnets constitute an emerging class of collinear magnets that exhibit zero net magnetization yet host spin-split electronic bands arising from non-relativistic spin-space-group symmetries. Realization of altermagnetism in the two-dimensional (2D) limit remains an outstanding challenge because dimensional reduction suppresses kZ dispersion and destabilizes the symmetry operations essential for spin compensation. Here, we demonstrate genuine 2D altermagnetism in epitaxial unit-cell-thin films of CrSb grown on Bi2Te3. It reveals a thickness-driven transition from a ferrimagnetic state in 1-unit-cell films to an altermagnetic state above a critical thickness of 7/4 unit cell. The transition originates from interfacial symmetry breaking at the Cr-terminated layer that induces local moment imbalance. With increasing thickness the key spin-space-group symmetries [C2||C6Zt] and [C2||MZ] restores, which leads to altermagnetism with zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent spin splitting. Our results provide the first experimental realization of altermagnetism in the 2D regime and establish a route for integrating stray-field-free spin order into nanoscale spintronic architectures.",

    "summary": "In this work we investigate efficient data compression for spatiotemporal Black, Azov and Marmara Seas temperature tensors that contain significant number of missing values. These tensors have a complex structure influenced by the coastlines and bathymetry, as well as temporal temperature changes. While such missing data typically provokes utilization of tensor completion algorithms, we demonstrate that standard SVD-based compression approaches (including the Tucker, Tensor-Train (TT) and Quantized-TT formats) are remarkably effective and yield comparable results. We propose a greedy spatial data partitioning algorithm enhancing their performance. We divide the data into the smaller subtensors before compression via exploitation of this trick.   Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strong temporal dependency in the data's compressibility caused by its nature. Fixing the level of precision we observe a significant seasonal variation. Investigating this, we find that a temporal partitioning on a scale of approximately two days is nearly optimal for all tested tensor based formats. The combined application of these spatial and temporal strategies with tensor methods ultimately achieves a robust compression ratio of 5 times across the entire dataset.",

    "summary": "High-performance, low-power transistors are core components of advanced integrated circuits, and the ultimate limitation of Moore's law has made the search for new alternative pathways an urgent priority. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have become the most promising exploration target due to their exceptional electronic properties and scalability. In this work, we conducted device transport research on the previously proposed 2D quaternary semiconductor Na2LiAlP2 using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The results demonstrate that even with a channel length of 5.7 nm, Na2LiAlP2 still exhibits excellent n-type transistor characteristics, fully meeting and surpassing the technical specifications outlined in the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). Encouragingly, the device can easily achieve the required on-state current of 900 {\\mu}A/{\\mu}m under low operating voltages of 0.1 V and 0.2 V. Moreover, at 0.1 V operating voltage, the device's subthreshold swing breaks through the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, reaching an astonishing value 30.33 mV/dec. Additionally, its p-type transistor performance also stands out with a subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec when the channel length is 7.9 nm. Our research not only showcases the exceptional transistor properties of Na2LiAlP2 but also further expands the research scope of 2D high-performance transistors.",

    "summary": "In many unconventional superconductors, the strange-metal regime is thought to emerge from quantum criticality, yet in cuprates this link is obscured by the enigmatic pseudogap. Superconducting infinite-layer nickelates provide a new arena to test this paradigm but are constrained to thin films, precluding calorimetry. We use the Seebeck coefficient as a low-temperature proxy for entropy per carrier and uncover a clear quantum-critical thermodynamic signature: in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at the onset of $T$-linear resistivity ($x=0.20$), $S/T$ diverges logarithmically upon cooling, $S/T \\propto \\log T$. Boltzmann transport based on ARPES-derived band structure reproduces the high-temperature magnitude and sign of $S/T$ and reveals a threefold mass renormalization at the Fermi level. To identify the terminating phase, we analyze Hall data across Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ and show that its temperature evolution is quantitatively captured by a minimal two-band model in which a strongly correlated Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fermi surface exhibits Planckian $T$-linear scattering while the rare-earth Nd-$s$ pocket remains Fermi-liquid-like. Inverting the zero-temperature Hall response reveals a collapse of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band carrier density from $1+p$ to $p$ holes across the critical doping, without long-range magnetic order -- mirroring the cuprate pseudogap transition in cuprates. These results establish a quantum critical point at the end of a pseudogap-like phase in infinite-layer nickelates and unify the broader paradigm among correlated superconductors that strange metal behaviour is intimately linked to quantum criticality.",

The protocol is defined in terms of a repeated cycle consisting of p layers of unitary gates applied to the system and ancilla \"bath\" qubits, followed by reset of the bath qubits. The gate parameters within each cycle are optimized such that the steady state achieved after many cycles has a low energy expectation value with respect to the target Hamiltonian, and that the energy converges toward the steady state value in as few cycles as possible. We illustrate the protocol for the transverse field Ising model, and study its systematic behaviors with respect to system size, model parameters, and noise using tensor network based classical simulations. We then experimentally demonstrate its operation on IBM's ibm_kingston quantum processor for up to 28 system qubits coupled to 14 bath sites. Classical training on small system sizes and with few unitary layers per cycle gives robust results that transfer well to larger system sizes and to noisy hardware.",

    "summary": "Electron Wigner solids (WSs)1-12 provide an ideal system for understanding the competing effects of electron-electron and electron-disorder interactions, a central unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Progress in this topic has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density ($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$ devices with varying long-range ($n_\\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range ($n_\\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the magnitude of $n_\\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\\mathrm{SR} \\lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\\mathrm{SR} \\gg n_e$ these features are suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher $n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a combined experimental-theoretical approach.",

    "summary": "Spin current generated electrically is among the core phenomena of spintronics for driving high-performance spin device applications. Here, on the basis of systematic investigations for the hole doped single-layer Haldane-Hubbard(HH) model, we propose a new bilayer HH model to realize the compensated odd-parity spin splitting and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity where the two layers are connected by the time reversal transformation. Our results show that the vanishing layer-dependent electric potential $V_{L}$ gives rise to odd-parity ALM protected by the combined symmetry $TM_{xy}$ with $T$ and $M_{xy}$ being the time reversal and mirror reflection perpendicular to $z$ axis, and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity simultaneously. In addition, though the staggered magnetization within each layer is substantially impacted by the layer-dependent electric potential, small $V_{L}$'s only bring negligible changes to the net magnetization and the spin Hall conductivity, indicating that the alternating spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall conductivity are insusceptible to external elements. Most importantly, our work provides a general framework for the simultaneous realization of the compensated odd-parity spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall conductivity in collinear magnets, in terms of stacked multi-layer systems.",

We consider an expanded Kitaev model with bilinear and biquadratic terms. At an exactly solvable point, the Hamiltonian can be reexpressed as a sum of projection operators. Unlike the AKLT model where projectors act on total spin, we project onto components of spin along the bond direction. This leads to exponential ground state degeneracy, expressed in terms of fractionalized spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ objects. Each ground state can be expressed concisely as a matrix product state. We construct a phase diagram by varying the relative strength of bilinear and biquadratic terms. The fractionalized states provide a qualitative picture for the spin-1 Kitaev model, yielding approximate forms for the ground state and low-lying excitations.",

    "summary": "Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the modeling of materials and molecules by directly fitting to ab initio data. However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient treatment of long-range interactions is required. To address this limitation, we introduce Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA), a framework designed to capture long-range interactions in the Fourier domain. RSA can be integrated with any existing local or semi-local MLIP framework. The central contribution of this work is the mapping of a linear-scaling attention mechanism into Fourier space, enabling the explicit modeling of long-range interactions such as electrostatics and dispersion without relying on predefined charges or other empirical assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a long-range correction to the MACE backbone across diverse benchmarks, including dimer binding curves, dispersion-dominated layered phosphorene exfoliation, and the molecular dipole density of bulk water. Our results show that RSA consistently captures long-range physics across a broad range of chemical and materials systems.

We show that anisotropic Heisenberg models on the honeycomb lattice and even on the square lattice reveal similarities to the full triangular lattice in the magnetization curve as well as in the transverse magnetization (superfluid) order parameter $m_\\perp$ at finite fields. Still, at $\\alpha \\ll 1$, results reveal gapless excitations and small but finite $m_\\perp >0 $ at effective fields corresponding to the triangular case without the field. In contrast, several additional numerical studies of the full model on the triangular lattice confirm the existence of the gap at $\\alpha \\ll 1$. In particular, the magnetization curve $m(h)$ as well as the spin stiffness $\\rho_s$ indicate (at zero field) a transition/crossover from gapped to gapless regime at $\\alpha \\sim \\alpha^*$ with $\\alpha^* \\lesssim 0.5$. We also show that deviations from the linear spin-wave theory and the emergence of the gap can be traced back to the strong effective repulsion between magnon excitations, having similarity to strongly correlated systems.",

Starting from a numerically identified phase transition point, we construct an exact second-order phase transition boundary through a similarity transformation in the real-energy regime. By introducing the biorthogonal entanglement entropy and biorthogonal Loschmidt echo, we demonstrate from both equilibrium and nonequilibrium perspectives that this transition belongs to the Ising universality class. Using the correlation function, we further distinguish between confined and deconfined phases within the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric region. In the complex-energy regime, we identify both a full $\\mathcal{PT}$ transition and a first-excited-state $\\mathcal{PT}$ transition, respectively. Moreover, we identify the location of the Yang-Lee edge singularity (YLES) using both the associated-biorthogonal and self-normal Loschmidt echoes, and extract the corresponding critical exponent, which agrees with the predictions of non-unitary conformal field theory. Finally, we propose an experimental scheme to observe the YLES in Rydberg atomic arrays, which offers a promising route to exploring non-Hermitian critical phenomena and singularities in future experimental settings.",

    "summary": "Owing to its high scalability and computational efficiency, machine learning methods have been increasingly integrated into various scientific research domains, including ab initio-based materials design. It has been demonstrated that, by incorporating modern machine learning algorithms, one can predict material properties with practically acceptable accuracy. However, one of the most significant limitations that restrict the widespread application of machine learning is its lack of transferability, as a given framework is typically applicable only to a specific property. The origin of this limitation is rooted in the fact that a material's properties are determined by multiple degrees of freedom -- and their complex interplay -- associated with nuclei and electrons, such as atomic type, structural symmetry, and the number and quantum states of the valence electrons, among others. The inherent complexity rules out the possibility of a single machine learning framework providing a full description of these critical quantities. In this paper, we develop a universal machine learning framework based solely on a physically grounded and theoretically rigorous descriptor -- electronic charge density. Our framework not only enables accurate prediction of eight different material properties (with R$^2$ values up to 0.94), but also demonstrates outstanding multi-task learning capability, as prediction accuracy improves when more target properties are incorporated into a single training process, thereby indicating excellent transferability. These results represent a significant step toward realizing the long-standing goal of a universal machine learning framework for the unified prediction of all material properties.",

We analyze the evolution of magnetic correlations and thermodynamic responses across different values of $t'/t$ and on-site interaction $U$. It is found that increasing $t'/t$ suppresses short-range antiferromagnetic correlations, while the next-nearest-neighbor correlations exhibit a sign change near $t'/t \\approx 0.3 \\text{--} 0.4$. Within this regime, the specific heat shows a pronounced low-temperature peak, indicating an emergent spin-related energy scale. Increasing $U$ enhances magnetic correlations and shifts the associated $t'/t$ crossover points to larger values.

    "summary": "We study measurement-induced entanglement generated by column-by-column sampling of noisy 2D random Clifford circuits of size $N$ and depth $T$. Focusing on the operator entanglement $S_{\\rm op}$ of the sampling-induced boundary state, first, we reproduce in the noiseless limit a finite-depth transition from area- to volume-law scaling. With on-site probablistic trace noise at any constant rate $p>0$, the maximal $S_{\\rm op}$ attained along the sampling trajectory obeys an area law in the boundary length and scales approximately linearly with $T/p$. By analyzing the spatial distribution of stabilizer generators, we observe exponential localization of stabilizer generators; this both accounts for the scaling of the maximal $S_{\\rm op}$ and implies an exponential decay of conditional mutual information across buffered tripartitions, which we also confirm numerically. Together, these results indicate that constant local noise destroys long-range, volume-law measurement-induced entanglement in 2D random Clifford circuits. Finally, based on the observed scaling, we conjecture that a tensor-network-based algorithm can efficiently sample from noisy 2D random Clifford circuits (i) at sub-logarithmic depths $T = o(\\log N)$ for any constant noise rate $p = \\Omega(1)$, and (ii) at constant depths $T = O(1)$ for noise rates $p = \\Omega(\\log^{-1}N)$.",

The method determines vertex corrections in the spin and charge channels self-consistently at the two-particle level, thereby avoiding the spurious finite-temperature phase transitions that limit dynamical mean-field theory in two dimensions. We derive the spectral self-energy and implement the framework directly on the real-frequency axis within the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, enabling the treatment of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states without relying on numerical analytic continuation. As an application, we demonstrate that a pseudogap can emerge in the bilayer Hubbard model when spin, charge, or excitonic fluctuations become sufficiently strong. Instabilities in different channels are also evaluated in an unbiased manner across the parameter space. Remarkably, we find that the excitonic susceptibility grows with increasing interlayer bias, before it gets suppressed at large biases by the charge imbalance between the layers. This work establishes a versatile and computationally efficient framework for investigating correlated multi-orbital systems under nonequilibrium conditions.",

    "summary": "Excitement about the magnetic and electronic properties of RuO$_2$ is growing, fueled by reports of antiferromagnetism, strain-induced superconductivity, and its recent classification as a member of a newly proposed magnetic class, altermagnets, with RuO$_2$ widely regarded as the paradigmatic example. Nevertheless, the magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ remains contentious, as several recent experiments report no evidence of magnetic order. To address this discrepancy, we performed resonant elastic scattering measurements on a series of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films grown on the (100)-plane of TiO$_2$ substrates across a range of strain states. Leveraging full polarization control and azimuthal scans of the structurally forbidden 100 Bragg reflection, we systematically tested for signatures of colinear antiferromagnetic order. We found that the resonant elastic scattering signal in RuO$_2$ thin films likely originates from anisotropic charge scattering, not long-range antiferromagnetic order. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we uncover a band structure without altermagnetic band splitting that is consistent with a nonmagnetic phase. Similarly, anisotropic magnetoresistance results show no evidence of magnetism. The combination of three independent measurements suggests the absence of altermagnetism in RuO$_2$.",

Here, we establish a spin-corner locking mechanism that generates second-order topological states in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems, through effective model analysis. Remarkably, the breaking of Mxy symmetry under uniaxial strain creates spin-resolved corner modes, driving the system into a corner-polarized second-order topological insulator (CPSOTI). Beyond critical strain, a topological phase transition to quantum anomalous Hall insulator occurs with quantized conductance. Through first-principles calculations, we identify two experimentally viable candidates for 2D intrinsic AM CrO and Cr$_2$Se$_2$O -- which host robust CPSOTI. Moreover, we construct the topological phase diagram of CrO and predict the existence of an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal phase. Our findings open technological avenues in altermagnetism and higher-order topology, while providing opportunities for coupling topological spintronics with cornertronics.",

Bulk single crystals grown by chemical vapor transport exhibit classical antiferromagnetic ground states with a transition temperature of ~40 K as revealed by susceptibility and specific heat measurements. Above 40 K, the susceptibilities show the large, broad peaks associated with a quantum spin-singlet ground state and large singlet-triplet gaps of 21 meV and 25 meV. Monte Carlo simulations, density matrix renormalization-group calculations for finite spin-3/2 chains, and density functional theory reproduce the experimental behavior, confirming the interplay between strong one-dimensional intrachain and weak three-dimensional interchain couplings. MoX3 offers a unique platform for exploring quantum magnetism and magnetic excitations at the atomic chain limit, as these materials combine a 1D van der Waals motif, spin chain behavior, and classical interchain order.",

With large-scale two-phase simulations powered by these potentials, we determine the melting curves of seifertite and pyrite-type SiO2 and infer the solid-solid phase boundary between these two phases. The SCAN functional, which captures intermediate-range van der Waals interactions, reproduces structural and thermodynamic properties with high fidelity, predicting melting temperatures 6-10 % higher and a seifertite to pyrite-type transition pressure 22 % higher than the PBEsol. The strongly negative Clapeyron slope (-6.1 MPa/K) of this transition suggests that mantle convection could be highly layered in super-Earth exoplanets, potentially affecting their long-term thermal evolution and habitability.",

Here, we identify monolayer Fe$_2X_2$O ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) as a new family of 2D altermagnetic real Chern insulators. These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switche the N\\'eel vector. These findings position 2D iron oxyhalides as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetism and magnetic topological states for spintronics and valleytronics.",

    "summary": "Periodically driven (Floquet) systems typically evolve toward an infinite-temperature thermal state due to continuous energy absorption. Before reaching equilibrium, however, they can transiently exhibit long-lived prethermal states that host exotic nonequilibrium phenomena, such as discrete time crystals (DTCs). In this study, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of periodically driven product states in a kicked Ising model implemented on the IBM Quantum Eagle and Heron processors. By using ancilla qubits to mediate interactions, we construct Kagome and Lieb lattices on superconducting qubits with heavy-hex connectivity. We identify two distinct types of noise-induced DTCs on Kagome and Lieb lattices, both arising from quantum noise in ancilla qubits. Type-I DTCs originate from robust boundary-mode period-doubling oscillations, stabilized by symmetry charge pumping, that are redistributed into the bulk due to ancilla noise. Type-II DTCs, in contrast, emerge in systems without charge-pumped qubits, where quantum noise unexpectedly stabilizes period-doubling oscillations that would otherwise rapidly decay. On the noisier Eagle device (ibm_kyiv), we observe both type-I and type-II DTCs on 53-qubit Kagome lattices with and without charge-pumped qubits, respectively. In contrast, on the lower-noise Heron device (ibm_marrakesh), period-doubling oscillations are confined to boundary-localized oscillations on 82-qubit Kagome and 40-qubit Lieb lattices, as redistribution into the bulk is suppressed. These experimental findings are supported by noisy matrix-product-state simulations, in which ancilla noise is modeled as random sign flips in the two-qubit gate rotation angles. Our results demonstrate that quantum noise in ancilla qubits can give rise to novel classes of prethermal dynamical phases, including boundary-protected and noise-induced DTCs.",

Experimental investigations in polycrystalline samples reveal that Sm doping monotonically decreases the lattice constants $c$ and $a$, thereby enhancing crystal structure distortion and leading to an evolution of the metallic ground state in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to an insulating state in La$_{1.5}$Sm$_{1.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The maximum onset $T_\\text{c}$ in compounds $x=0.9$ and 1.5 is 89 K, while the pressure that drives the emergence of superconductivity is higher for higher doping levels. The results suggest that the enhancement of $T_\\text{c}$ in La$_{3-x}$Sm$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is mainly affected by the compressed $c$ lattice before saturation, and the structure transition is critical for the emergence of superconductivity. Our experimental results provide insight into the influence of elemental substitution on nickelate superconductors, offering a means to increase the transition temperature further.",

    "summary": "Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) is a well-established tool for probing excitations in a wide range of materials. The measured spectra strongly depend on the scattering geometry, via its influence on the polarization of the incoming and outgoing light. By employing a tensor representation of the 4-point response function that governs the RIXS intensity, we disentangle the experimental geometry from the intrinsic material properties. In dipole-dipole RIXS processes and low-symmetry crystals, up to 81 linearly independent fundamental spectra can be measured as a function of light polarization. However, for crystals or molecules with symmetry, the number of independent fundamental spectra that define the RIXS tensor is significantly reduced.   This work presents a systematic framework for determining the number of fundamental spectra and expressing the RIXS tensor in terms of these fundamental components. Given a specific experimental geometry, the measured spectrum can be represented as a linear combination of these fundamental spectra. To validate our approach, we performed calculations for different point group symmetries, both with and without an applied magnetic field. Within the same framework, we derived expressions for powder spectra in momentum-independent processes and spectra obtained using Bragg spectrometers. This formalism provides a valuable toolkit for optimizing experiment planning, data interpretation, and RIXS simulation.",

Matrix product states, for instance, are efficient but limited to area law entangled states. Neural quantum states (NQS) are widely believed to overcome such limitations, yet little is known about their fundamental constraints. Here we prove that feed-forward neural quantum states acting on $n$ spins with $k$ scalar nonlinearities, under certain analyticity assumptions, obey a bound on entanglement entropy for any subregion: $S \\leq c k\\log n$, for a constant $c$. This establishes an NQS analog of the area law constraint for matrix product states and rules out volume law entanglement for NQS with $O(1)$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the scaling with $n$ is tight for a wide variety of NQS. Our work establishes a fundamental constraint on NQS that applies broadly across different network designs, while reinforcing their substantial expressive power.",

Based on spin group symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, a novel hydroxyl rotation strategy in collinear antiferromagnets has been proposed to design altermagnets. This approach achieves a large chirality-reversible spin splitting exceeding $1130$ meV in $\\alpha_{60}$-Mn$_2$B$_2$(OH)$_2$ monolayer. The system also exhibits intrinsic features of a node-line semimetal in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Besides, the angles of hydroxyl groups serve as the primary order parameter, which can switch on/off the altermagnetism coupled with the ferroelastic mechanism. The corresponding magnetocrystalline anisotropy have also been modulated. Moreover, an interesting spin-related transport property with the spin-polarized conductivity of 10$^{19}$ $\\Omega^{-1}m^{-1}s^{-1}$ also emerges. These findings uncover the hydroxyl rotation strategy as a versatile tool for designing altermagnetic node-line semimetals and opening new avenues for achieving exotic chemical and physical characteristics associated with large spin splitting.",

In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss our results, especially for the $\\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of quantum magnets.",

Here, we numerically demonstrate bosonic FCIs in two types of non-Chern flat bands in honeycomb lattices, using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations. In a gapless flat band with a singular band touching, we observe a Laughlin state at half filling, stabilized by onsite interactions from the hard-core limit down to arbitrarily small strength. Furthermore, we report the first example of a non- Abelian FCI in a non-Chern band system: a Moore-Read state at $\\nu$ = 1 filling of the same singular flat band with hard-core bosons. Under lattice parameters that realize a gapped trivial band (C = 0) of exact flatness, we also find the Laughlin FCI of soft-core bosons in the isolated band limit where onsite interaction is much smaller than the band gap. In this case, the FCI forms as interacting bosons spontaneously avoid the peaks in quantum metric and Berry curvature, preferentially occupying Brillouin zone region with relatively uniform quantum geometry. Our work significantly expands the landscape for (non-)Abelian FCIs and broadens the understanding of their formation beyond the Chern band paradigm.",

We find that the onset temperature of the short-range spin-density-wave (SDW) formation increases with the substituted Sn content, indicating the impurity-induced stabilization of the SDW order, reminiscent of the disorder/impurity-induced spin order in the cuprate superconductors. The Seebeck coefficient is well related to such impurity effects, as it is slightly enhanced below the onset temperatures, implying a decrease in the carrier concentration due to a pseudo-gap formation associated with the SDW ordering. We discuss the site-dependent substitution effects including earlier studies, and suggest that substitution to the conducting CoO$_2$ layers is essential to increase the onset temperature, consistent with the impurity-induced SDW picture realized in the conducting layers with the cylindrical Fermi surface.",

This paper introduces a rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system, rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models, we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness of the proposal.",

Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R}) \\times \\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.",

A key distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where $p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance $\\rho_{zz}(\\theta, \\phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band Hamiltonian. While the SDW Yamaji azimuthal angle $\\theta$ is marginally smaller than the FL* Yamaji $\\theta$, the most significant difference is the presence of a second Yamaji peak in the SDW theory near in-plane angle $\\phi = 45^\\circ$; there is no such second peak in the observations in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$. Furthermore, we examine the role of anisotropic interlayer hopping present in LSCO, and predict the potential emergence of the Yamaji effect in LSCO at higher magnetic fields. Our results support the FL* interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.",

However, the direct application of the tensor train method typically requires uniform grids of regular domains, which limits its application on non-uniform grids or irregular domains. To address the limitation, we develop a functional tensor train neural network (FTTNN) for solving high-dimensional PDEs, which can represent PDE solutions on non-uniform grids or irregular domains. An essential ingredient of our approach is to represent the PDE solutions by the functional tensor train format whose TT-core functions are approximated by neural networks. To give the functional tensor train representation, we propose and study functional tensor train rank and employ it into a physics-informed loss function for training. Because of tensor train representation, the resulting high-dimensional integral in the loss function can be computed via one-dimensional integrals by Gauss quadrature rules. Numerical examples including high-dimensional PDEs on regular or irregular domains are presented to demonstrate that the performance of the proposed FTTNN is better than that of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN).",

Here, we discover $temporal$ $entanglement$ $transitions$ in a Floquet spin chain, which correspond to a quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the entanglement Hamiltonian and are signaled by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show that these transitions are entanglement-driven, i.e., they require initially entangled states and remain invisible to conventional local observables. Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips. At high frequencies, the entanglement Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period, rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\\nu=1$, matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality. Our work establishes temporal entanglement transitions as novel features in Floquet quantum matter.",

Here, we propose a new multiferroic state, i.e. ferroelastic altermagnetic state, in which ferroelastic strain couples directly to the spin-splitting. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify the ferroelastic $d$-wave altermagnetism of puckered pentagonal CoSe$_2$ monolayer. Interestingly, uniaxial stress can induce a ferroelastic phase transition, accompanied by a $90^\\circ$ rotation of the spin-splitting bands. Cooperative rotation of the lattice and N\\'eel vectors preserves the sign of Kerr angle, whereas noncooperative rotation reverses it.

    "summary": "Drawing the quantum phase diagram of a many-body system in the parameter space of its Hamiltonian can be seen as a learning problem, which implies labelling the corresponding ground states according to some classification criterium that defines the phases. In this work we adopt unsupervised learning, where the algorithm has no access to any priorly labeled states, as a tool for determining quantum phase diagrams of many-body systems. The algorithm directly works with quantum states: given the ground-state configurations for different values of the Hamiltonian parameters, the process uncovers the most significant way of grouping them based on a similarity criterion that refers to the fidelity between quantum states, that can be easily estimated, even experimentally. We benchmark our method with two specific spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ chains, with states determined via tensor network techniques. We find that unsupervised learning algorithms based on spectral clustering, combined with ``silhouette'' and ``elbow'' methods for determining the optimal number of phases, can accurately reproduce the phase diagrams. Our results show how unsupervised learning can autonomously recognize and possibly unveil novel phases of quantum matter.",

    "summary": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is central to science and engineering, but faces severe scalability challenges, especially in high-dimensional, multiscale, and turbulent regimes. Traditional numerical methods often become prohibitively expensive under these conditions. Quantum computing and quantum-inspired methods have been investigated as promising alternatives. This review surveys advances at the intersection of quantum computing, quantum algorithms, machine learning, and tensor network techniques for CFD. We discuss the use of Variational Quantum Algorithms as hybrid quantum-classical solvers for PDEs, emphasizing their ability to incorporate nonlinearities through Quantum Nonlinear Processing Units. We further review Quantum Neural Networks and Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks, which extend classical machine learning frameworks to quantum hardware and have shown advantages in parameter efficiency and solution accuracy for certain CFD benchmarks. Beyond quantum computing, we examine tensor network methods, originally developed for quantum many-body systems and now adapted to CFD as efficient high-dimensional compression and solver tools. Reported studies include several orders of magnitude reductions in memory and runtime while preserving accuracy. Together, these approaches highlight quantum and quantum-inspired strategies that may enable more efficient CFD solvers. This review closes with perspectives: quantum CFD remains out of reach in the NISQ era, but quantum-inspired tensor networks already show practical benefits, with hybrid approaches offering the most promising near-term strategy.",

State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \\log N)$ scaling per sweep.   Our approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain, revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient exact Gibbs sampling update.   We validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$ algorithms on $32\\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock time, empirically demonstrating $N \\log N$ scaling. By reformulating a long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens avenues for physics-inspired generative models.",

    "summary": "Understanding and optimizing polysulfide adsorption and conversion processes are critical to mitigating shuttle effects and sluggish redox kinetics in lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, we introduce a machine-learning-accelerated framework, Precise and Accurate Configuration Evaluation (PACE), that integrates Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) with Density Functional Theory (DFT) to systematically explore adsorption configurations and energetics of a series of N6-coordinated dual-atom catalysts (DACs). Our results demonstrate that, compared with single-atom catalysts, DACs exhibit improved LiPS adsorption and redox conversion through cooperative metal-sulfur interactions and electronic coupling between adjacent metal centers. Among all DACs, Fe-Ni and Fe-Pt show optimal catalytic performance, due to their optimal adsorption energies (-1.0 to -2.3 eV), low free-energy barriers (<=0.4 eV) for the Li2S2 to Li2S conversion, and facile Li2S decomposition barriers (<=1.0 eV). To accelerate catalyst screening, we further developed a machine learning (ML) regression model trained on DFT-calculated data to predict the Gibbs free energy (\\Delta G) of Li2Sn adsorption using physically interpretable descriptors. The Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) model yields an R^2 of 0.85 and an MAE of 0.26 eV, enabling the rapid prediction of \\Delta G for unexplored DACs. Electronic-structure analyses reveal that the superior performance originates from the optimal d-band alignment and S-S bond polarization induced by the cooperative effect of dual metal centres. This dual ML-DFT framework demonstrates a generalizable, data-driven design strategy for the rational discovery of efficient catalysts for next-generation LSBs.",

    "summary": "In recent years, rapid progress has been made in developing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods for x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis. Compared to traditional XAS analysis methods, AI/ML approaches offer dramatic improvements in efficiency and help eliminate human bias. To advance this field, we advocate an AI-driven XAS analysis pipeline that features several inter-connected key building blocks: benchmarks, workflows, databases, and AI/ML models. Specifically, we present two case studies for XAS ML. In the first study, we demonstrate the importance of reconciling the discrepancies between simulation and experiment using spectral domain mapping (SDM). Our ML model, which is trained solely on simulated spectra, predicts an incorrect oxidation state trend for Ti atoms in a combinatorial zinc titanate film. After transforming the experimental spectra into a simulation-like representation using SDM, the same model successfully recovers the correct oxidation state trend. In the second study, we explore the development of universal XAS ML models that are trained on the entire periodic table, which enables them to leverage common trends across elements. Looking ahead, we envision that an AI-driven pipeline can unlock the potential of real-time XAS analysis to accelerate scientific discovery.",

Here, we establish a spin-corner locking mechanism that generates second-order topological states in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems, through effective model analysis. Remarkably, the breaking of Mxy symmetry under uniaxial strain creates spin-resolved corner modes, driving the system into a corner-polarized second-order topological insulator (CPSOTI). Beyond critical strain, a topological phase transition to quantum anomalous Hall insulator occurs with quantized conductance. Through first-principles calculations, we identify two experimentally viable candidates for 2D intrinsic AM CrO and Cr$_2$Se$_2$O -- which host robust CPSOTI. Moreover, we construct the topological phase diagram of CrO and predict the existence of an altermagnetic Weyl semimetal phase. Our findings open technological avenues in altermagnetism and higher-order topology, while providing opportunities for coupling topological spintronics with cornertronics.",

    "summary": "We propose a new pathway to the quantized anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) by coupling an altermagnet to a topological crystalline insulator (TCI). The former gaps the topological surface states of the TCI, thereby realizing the QAHE in a robust and switchable platform with near- vanishing magnetization. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by studying a slab of the TCI SnTe coupled to an altermagnetic RuO2 layer. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the d-wave altermagnetism in RuO2 induces a 7 meV gap to the Dirac surface states on the (110) surface of SnTe, producing a finite anomalous Hall effect. Our approach generalizes to broader classes of altermagnetic materials and TCIs, thereby providing a family of topological altermagnetic heterostructures with small or vanishing magnetization that support nontrivial Chern numbers. Our results highlight a promising new topological platform with great tunability and applications to spintronics.",

    "summary": "Granular materials densify under repeated mechanical perturbations, a nonequilibrium dynamics that underlies many natural and industrial processes. Because granular relaxation is governed by frictional contacts and energy dissipation, this aging behavior fundamentally differs from that of thermal glasses despite their apparent similarities. Here, we uncover how friction controls the compaction dynamics of granular packings subjected to cyclic shear. Using discrete element simulations, we construct a dynamic state diagram as a function of strain amplitude and friction, revealing a rich interplay between jamming marginality, stabilization, and fluidization. We identify a friction-dependent crossover strain that separates aging and fluidized regimes, showing reentrant, non-monotonic behavior: Increasing friction first suppresses fluidization, then promotes it through smooth, creep-like rearrangements. This transition is marked by a shift from intermittent, avalanche-like rearrangements to continuous, diffusive motion. Our findings demonstrate that friction exerts a dual role in granular aging -- both stabilizing and fluidizing -- thereby uncovering the fundamental nonequilibrium mechanisms that govern compaction, rheology, and aging in athermal disordered systems. More broadly, our results reveal a general principle for how friction governs metastability and flow in athermal matter -- from granular and frictional colloids to soils and seismic faults -- linking microscopic contact mechanics to macroscopic dynamics.",

    "summary": "The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\\lesssim 2\\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.",

    "summary": "Multiferroics, which combine ferroelectric and magnetic order, offer a transformative platform for next-generation electronic devices. However, the intrinsic competition between the mechanisms driving ferroelectricity and magnetism in single-phase materials severely limits their performance, typically resulting in weak magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature. Here, we propose a solution to this long-standing challenge through the novel concept of fractional quantum multiferroics (FQMF), where strong magnetoelectric coupling is naturally realized by coupling fractional quantum ferroelectricity (FQFE) with altermagnetism (AM). Symmetry analysis shows that reversing the FQFE polarization necessarily inverts the AM spin splitting under parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) or time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}\\tau$) operations. A minimal tight-binding model reproduces this effect, demonstrating electrically driven spin control without rotating the N\\'eel vector. First-principles calculations further identify a broad family of candidate materials in two and three dimensions including bulk MnTe, Cr$_2$S$_3$, Mn$_4$Bi$_3$NO$_{15}$ and two-dimensional AB$_2$ bilayers such as MnX$_2$ (X=Cl, Br, I), CoCl$_2$, CoBr$_2$, and FeI$_2$. Notably, MnTe exhibits a high N\\'eel temperature ($\\sim$300 K) and a large electrically switchable spin splitting ($\\sim$0.8 eV), demonstrating room-temperature magnetoelectric performance that surpasses that of conventional multiferroics. To further showcase the technological potential, we propose an electric-field-controlled FQMF tunnel junction based on MnTe that achieves tunneling magnetoresistance exceeding 300\\%. This work establishes FQMF as a distinct and promising route to achieving room-temperature strong magnetoelectric coupling, opening a new avenue for voltage-controlled spintronics.",

These two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for applications in advanced gas sensing and catalysis. Our analysis reveals that Ni-doped graphene, validated through work function calculations, is a promising material for gas separation and hydrogen production. The samples with adsorbed molecules are characterized by calculating chemical potential, chemical hardness, electronegativity, electrophilicity, vibrational frequencies, adsorbtion and Gibbs energies by DFT calculations. Methane molecules preferentially adsorb at the hexagonal ring centers of graphene, while ammonia inter-acts more strongly with carbon atoms, highlighting distinct molecular doping mechanisms for CH4 and NH3. Dynamic simulations show that CH4 splits into CH3+H, with Ni-doped graphene facilitating enhanced hydrogen transmission, while NH3 dissociates into NH2+H, which may lead to N2H4 formation. Our non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) simulations demonstrate increased H-atom transmission on Ni-doped graphene during gas interactions. These findings suggest that Ni-doped graphene is superior to pristine graphene for applications in gas separation, hydrogen production, and high-sensitivity sensors.",

    "summary": "Electron Wigner solids (WSs)1-12 provide an ideal system for understanding the competing effects of electron-electron and electron-disorder interactions, a central unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Progress in this topic has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density ($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$ devices with varying long-range ($n_\\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range ($n_\\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the magnitude of $n_\\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\\mathrm{SR} \\lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\\mathrm{SR} \\gg n_e$ these features are suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher $n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a combined experimental-theoretical approach.",

Our approach couples semi-Lagrangian (SL) time discretizations with Tensor-Train (TT) decompositions to tame the curse of dimensionality. By reformulating the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck equations as a sequence of advection-diffusion-reaction subproblems within a smoothed policy iteration, we construct both first and second order in time SL schemes. The TT format and appropriate quadrature rules reduce storage and computational cost from exponential to polynomial in the dimension. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our TT-accelerated SL methods achieve their theoretical convergence rates, exhibit modest growth in memory usage and runtime with dimension, and significantly outperform grid-based SL in accuracy per CPU second.",

Our focus is on parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric spin chains, specifically the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising and XX models. We calculate stabilizer R\\'enyi entropies in their ground states using non-Hermitian matrix product state methods. Our findings show that magic exhibits unique and model-specific signs of phase transitions. In the Ising chain, it peaks along the regular Hermitian-like critical line but disappears across exceptional points. In contrast, in the XX chain, it reaches its maximum at the exceptional line where $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is broken. Finite-size scaling reveals that these effects become more pronounced with larger systems, highlighting non-stabilizerness as a sensitive marker for both quantum criticality and non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies. We also investigate magic in momentum space for the XX model analytically and find that is reaches a minimum around exceptional points. Our results indicate that magic takes extremal values at the exceptional points and serves as a valuable tool for examining complexity, criticality, and symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian quantum matter.",

    "summary": "The crystal lattice governs the emergent electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of quantum materials, making structural tuning through strain, pressure, or chemical substitution a key approach for discovering and controlling novel quantum phases. Beyond static modifications, driving specific lattice modes with ultrafast stimuli offers a dynamic route for tailoring material properties out of equilibrium. However, achieving dynamic coherent control of the nonequilibrium phases via resonant excitation of lattice coherences remains largely unexplored. Such manipulation enables non-volatile, on demand amplification and suppression of order parameters on femtosecond timescales, necessary for next generation optoelectronic ultrafast computation. In this study, we demonstrate coherent phononic control of a newly discovered, light-induced metastable magnetization in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. By using a sequence of terahertz (THz) pulses, we modulate the magnetization amplitude at the frequencies of phonon coherences, whose infrared-active nature and symmetries are further revealed by polarization- and field-strength-dependent measurements. Furthermore, our two-dimensional THz spectroscopy, in tandem with first-principles numerical simulations, shows that these phonons nonlinearly displace a Raman active phonon, which induces the metastable net magnetization. These findings not only clarify the microscopic mechanism underlying the metastable state in FePS3 but also establish vibrational coherences in solids as a powerful tool for ultrafast quantum phase control, enabling manipulation of material functionalities far from equilibrium.",

Utilizing the neural network quantum state technique, we explore the influence of disorder on spin textures, topological properties, and quantum entanglement. We show that the disorder reduces the stability of quantum skyrmions, ultimately causing them to collapse at high disorder strengths. In addition, our results reveal two key insights. First, the presence of disorder, rather than simply degrading skyrmion order, significantly enhances local quantum entanglement, as evidenced by the rise in second R\\'enyi entropy. Second, our calculations show that the topological entanglement entropy calculated using the second R\\'enyi entropy remains negligible across all the disorder strengths. This suggests long-range entanglement is absent and the skyrmion phase is not detectable using this specific probe. Overall, our work provides new insights into how disorder constructively influences quantum materials.",

The results show the susceptibility onset temperature tracks the critical temperature ($T_c$) of HTSCs with a comparable scale across the electron filling factor. Also, as the electron filling decreases and the chemical potential approaches the antinodal van Hove region, the susceptibility at $\\mathbf{q}=(\\pi,0)$ -- the axial particle-hole response -- grows markedly.   The emergence of cuprate superconductivity correlates with a suppression of low-energy antinodal spin response and associated particle-hole excitations, which would otherwise dephase $d$-wave pairing, commonly attributed to spin fluctuations. In this context, the pseudogap partially suppresses antinodal spectral weight near $\\omega = 0$, thereby reducing the low-$\\omega$ particle-hole phase space.",

One fruitful approach is to develop solvable toy models that encapsulate universal properties shared by realistic systems. In this work, we introduce the Brownian SYK-Hubbard model, which combines the all-to-all random interactions of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with on-site Hubbard-type interactions. This hybrid construction enables the study of the interplay between nonlocal random dynamics and local correlation effects: (1) As the interaction strength increases, the single-particle spectrum exhibits a transition from a single peak to a two-peak structure, signaling the onset of Mottness. (2) The spectral form factor undergoes a sequence of dynamical transitions as the evolution time increases before reaching the plateau in the long-time limit under strong Hubbard interactions. (3) The out-of-time-order correlator is computed by summing a series of modified ladder diagrams, which determines the quantum Lyapunov exponent and reveals a violation of the bound on branching time. Our results establish a new analytically tractable platform for exploring the effects of Hubbard interactions in chaotic many-body systems.",

    "summary": "The formation and subsequent growth of structural defects in an irradiated material can strongly influence the material's performance in technological and industrial applications. Predicting how the growth of defects affects material performance is therefore a pressing problem in materials science. One common computational approach that is used to examine defect growth is cluster dynamics, a method which employs a system of mean-field rate equations to track the time evolution of concentrations of individual defect types. However, the computational complexity of performing cluster dynamics can limit its practical implementation, specifically in the context of exploring a broad set of physical conditions corresponding to, for example, different temperatures and pressures. Here, we present a machine learning approach to circumvent the computational challenges of performing cluster dynamics while maintaining high accuracy in the prediction of defect concentrations. The method is illustrated on the nuclear material uranium nitride but is broadly applicable to other materials. The developed data-driven method is shown to accurately capture complex correlations between material properties, temperature, irradiation conditions, and the concentration of defects.",

    "summary": "We introduce UEIPNet, an equivariant graph neural network designed to predict both interatomic potentials and tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonians for an atomic structure. The UEIPNet is trained using density functional theory calculations followed by Wannier projection to predict energies and forces as node-level targets and Wannier-projected TB matrices as edge-level targets. This enables physically consistent modeling of coupled mechanical electronic responses with near-DFT accuracy. Trained on bilayer graphene and monolayer MoS2 DFT data, UEIPNet captures key deformation-electronic effects: in twisted bilayer graphene, it reveals how interlayer spacing, in-plane strain, and out-of-plane corrugation drive isolated flat-band formation, and further shows that modulating substrate interaction strength can generate flat bands even away from the magic angle. For monolayer MoS2, the UEIPNet accurately reproduces phonon dispersions, strain-dependent band-gap evolution, and local density of states modulations under non-uniform strain. The UEIPNet offers a generalized, efficient, and scalable framework for studying deformation-electronic coupling in large-scale atomistic systems, bridging classical atomistic simulations and electronic-structure calculations.",

    "summary": "A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/jw9730/spectral-mean-flow.",

The study examined two distinct central regions, which included a circular disc and a regular hexagonal area that connected to semi-infinite zigzag and armchair borophene nanoribbon leads. The system was described by a five-band tight-binding Hamiltonian parameterized using first-principles data, and the transport properties were calculated within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework. Spin resolved transmissions and spin polarization were computed for a range of lead widths and proximity-induced exchange field strengths. The analysis revealed distinct transport characteristics determined by geometry and edge configuration: armchair-connected structures exhibited broader and more stable fully spin-polarized windows compared with zigzag-connected counterparts. Furthermore, critical lead-width thresholds ($\\approx 1.01$ nm for zigzag and $\\approx 0.87$ nm for armchair) and a moderate exchange field above which complete spin filtering occurs were identified. The results highlight the strong influence of edge termination and confinement geometry on transport properties and provide useful design guidelines for developing borophene-based nanoscale spintronic devices.",

However, assessing the quantum many-body Hamiltonian realized in a specific experiment remains an exceptional open challenge, due to the difficulty of disentangling competing terms accounting for the many-body excitations. Here, we demonstrate a machine learning strategy to learn a quantum many-body spin Hamiltonian from scanning spectroscopy measurements of spin excitations. Our methodology leverages the spatially-resolved reconstruction of the many-body excitations induced by depositing quantum impurities next to the quantum magnet. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows us to predict long-range Heisenberg exchange interactions, anisotropic exchange, as well as antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, including in the presence of sizable noise. Our methodology establishes defect-induced spatially-resolved dynamical excitations in quantum magnets as a powerful strategy to understand the nature of quantum spin many-body models.",

The underlying tensor decomposition is based on the reshaping of the input matrix and its butterfly decomposition into an order $\\mathcal{O} (\\log n)$ tensor. The reshaping of the input matrix into a tensor allows for representation of the butterfly decomposition as a tensor decomposition with dense tensors. This leads to efficient utilization of the existing software infrastructure for dense and sparse tensor computations. We propose two tensor completion algorithms in the butterfly format, using alternating least squares and gradient-based optimization, as well as a novel strategy that uses low-rank matrix completion to efficiently generate an initial guess for the proposed algorithms. To demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of our proposed algorithms, we perform three numerical experiments using simulated oscillatory operators in seismic applications. In these experiments, we use $\\mathcal {O} (n \\log n)$ observed entries in the input matrix and demonstrate an $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log^3 n)$ computational cost of the proposed algorithms, leading to a speedup of orders of magnitudes per iteration for large matrices compared to the low-rank matrix and quantized tensor-train completion. Moreover, the proposed butterfly completion algorithms, equipped with the novel initial guess generation strategy, achieve reconstruction errors that are smaller by an order of magnitude, enabling accurate recovery of the underlying structure compared to the state-of-the-art completion algorithms.",

The results show the susceptibility onset temperature tracks the critical temperature ($T_c$) of HTSCs with a comparable scale across the electron filling factor. Also, as the electron filling decreases and the chemical potential approaches the antinodal van Hove region, the susceptibility at $\\mathbf{q}=(\\pi,0)$ -- the axial particle-hole response -- grows markedly.   The emergence of cuprate superconductivity correlates with a suppression of low-energy antinodal spin response and associated particle-hole excitations, which would otherwise dephase $d$-wave pairing, commonly attributed to spin fluctuations. In this context, the pseudogap partially suppresses antinodal spectral weight near $\\omega = 0$, thereby reducing the low-$\\omega$ particle-hole phase space.",

    "summary": "X-ray and neutron diffraction are foundational tools for determining crystal structures, but their resolution limits can lead to misassignments, especially in materials with subtle distortions or competing phases. Here, we demonstrate the use of nonlinear transport as a complementary approach to uncover hidden crystal symmetries, using the strongly correlated Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ as a case study. Below 48 K (T$_S$), where the magnetic moments of the antiferromagnetic phase reorient from the a- to the b-axis, leading to a pseudogap opening, our measurements, with support of DFT, reveal a previously overlooked lower-symmetry phase. This is manifested by the emergence of longitudinal nonlinear resistance (NLR) along the b-axis below T$_S$, providing direct evidence of combined translational and time-reversal symmetry breaking. This response also suggests a transformation from a conventional antiferromagnet into an altermagnet. The lower-symmetry phase arises from a subtle lattice distortion (~0.1 pm) associated with the magnetic transition at T$_S$, below the detection limit of conventional diffraction. Moreover, this NLR below T$_S$ is accompanied by a nonlinear Hall effect, both of which are enhanced by the large quantum metric associated with Weyl chains near the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate nonlinear transport as a sensitive probe of hidden symmetry breaking and altermagnetism, complementing and extending beyond the reach of traditional diffraction and spectroscopic techniques.",

    "summary": "Sesqui-chalcogenides serve as a critical bridge between traditional semiconductors and quantum materials, offering significant potential in applications such as thermoelectrics, phase change memory, and topological insulators. While considerable attention has been focused on antimony- and bismuth-based compounds, characterized by substantial property changes upon reduction in film thickness, indium containing sesqui-chalcogenides like In$_2$Te$_3$ are emerging as promising candidates for photovoltaics and electronic devices. However, the effects of film thickness on the properties of In$_2$Te$_3$ remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate high-quality In$_2$Te$_3$ thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(111) substrates across a thickness range from 2.7 nm to 24 nm. We employ X-ray diffraction, reflective high-energy electron diffraction and atomic force microscopy to analyze both the crystal structure and film morphology. Additionally, we utilize broadband optical spectroscopy alongside femtosecond pump-probe measurements and Raman spectroscopy to assess optical and vibrational properties, respectively. Our analysis reveals that material properties exhibit minimal dependence on film thickness, contrasting sharply with behavior observed in other chalcogenides such as Sb$_2$Te$_3$, Bi$_2$Se$_3$, or GeTe. This phenomenon can be attributed to covalent bonding present in In$_2$Te$_3$, which differs from those in its antimony- and bismuth-containing counterparts.",

    "summary": "Traditional machine learning has advanced polymer discovery, yet direct generation of chemically valid and synthesizable polymers without exhaustive enumeration remains a challenge. Here we present polyT5, an encoder-decoder chemical language model based on the T5 architecture, trained to understand and generate polymer structures. polyT5 enables both property prediction and the targeted generation of polymers conditioned on desired property values. We demonstrate its utility for dielectric polymer design, seeking candidates with dielectric constant >3, bandgap >4 eV, and glass transition temperature >400 K, alongside melt-processability and solubility requirements. From over 20,000 generated promising candidates, one was experimentally synthesized and validated, showing strong agreement with predictions. To further enhance usability, we integrated polyT5 within an agentic AI framework that couples it with a general-purpose LLM, allowing natural language interaction for property prediction and generative design. Together, these advances establish a versatile and accessible framework for accelerated polymer discovery.",

    "summary": "We employ interpretable explicit machine learning to analyze the material dependence of the magnetic transition temperature $T_c$ in ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic Heusler compounds. For around 200 compounds, we consider both experimental $T_c$ and calculated $T_c$ using \\textit{ab initio} determination of magnetic interactions together with a Monte-Carlo solution. We use the hierarchical dependence extraction (HDE) procedure [Mor\\'ee and Arita, Phys. Rev. B 110, 014502 (2024)] to extract the dependencies of $T_c$ on chemical proportions and magnetic moments from the main order to the higher order, and construct an explicit expression of $T_c$ from these dependencies. The main results are: (a) $T_c$ is mainly controlled by the proportions of Fe, Co, and Mn, and increases with these proportions, consistent with previous machine learning analyses of ferromagnetic materials. (b) The HDE describes $T_c$ with an accuracy that is comparable to that of other machine learning procedures. (c) The HDE expression of $T_c$ can be interpreted as a generalized order parameter that increases with increasing magnetization amplitude, in qualitative agreement with various theories of phase transitions. These results strengthen our understanding of the material dependence of $T_c$ in collinear Heusler magnets and motivate the further use of HDE in material design.",

    "summary": "Multiferroic materials, particularly rare-earth orthochromates (RECrO$_3$), have garnered significant interest due to their unique magnetic and electric-polar properties, making them promising candidates for multifunctional devices. Although extensive research has been conducted on their antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature (N$\\acute{\\textrm{e}}$el temperature, $T_\\textrm{N}$), ferroelectricity, and piezoelectricity, the effects of doping and substitution of rare-earth (RE) elements on these properties remain insufficiently explored. In this study, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were employed to predict and analyze the physical properties of RECrO$_3$ compounds under various doping scenarios. Experimental and literature data were integrated to train machine learning models, enabling accurate predictions of $T_\\textrm{N}$, besides remanent polarization ($P_\\textrm{r}$) and piezoelectric coefficients ($d_{33}$). The results indicate that doping with specific RE elements significantly impacts $T_\\textrm{N}$, with optimal doping levels identified for enhanced performance. Furthermore, high-entropy RECrO$_3$ compounds were systematically analyzed, demonstrating how the inclusion of multiple RE elements influences magnetic properties. This work establishes a robust framework for predicting and optimizing the properties of RECrO$_3$ materials, offering valuable insights into their potential applications in energy storage and sensor technologies.",

Here, we demonstrate circular polarization of the interlayer exciton emission in a (BA)2PbI4/WSe2 monolayer heterostructure. The helicity of this emission is controlled by tuning the energy of the excitation laser through the manifold of exciton resonances of the WSe2 monolayer, together with an emerging interlayer absorption feature of the heterostructure. Theoretical calculations show that this resonance arises from hybridized (BA)2PbI4/WSe2 states in the valence band. This hybrid character enables its observation in both linear absorption and ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopies, and plays a key role in controlling the sign of the helicity of the interlayer exciton emission. The tunable spin polarization demonstrated here, with the WSe2 monolayer effectively acting as a tunable spin filter, represents an important step toward the use of 2D perovskites in opto-spintronic applications.",

Low-energy effective descriptions of the dynamics must be consistent with this microscopic analyticity constraint. We consider two canonical low-energy fermionic Green's functions describing non-Fermi liquids, the marginal Fermi liquid and the `Hertz liquid'. The pole in these Green's functions must be outside of the Lieb-Robinson domain of analyticity for all complex momenta captured by the low-energy theory. We show that this constraint upper bounds the magnitude of the dimensionless non-Fermi liquid coupling in certain Hertz liquids. We furthermore obtain, from causality, an upper bound on the magnitude $|G^R(\\omega,{\\bf k})|$ within the analytic domain. We use this bound to constrain the quasiparticle residue of the non-Fermi liquids.",

In the unfrustrated regime, the model exhibits a quantum ferrimagnetic phase that captures key magnetic features of the nickel-based polymeric compound [Ni3(OH)2(C4H2O4)(H2O)4].2H2O such as a at minimum in the temperature dependence of the susceptibility times temperature product and an intermediate one-third magnetization plateau. In the frustrated regime, we uncover a rich variety of unconventional quantum phases including uniform and cluster-based Haldane states, fragmented monomer-dimer phase, and bound-magnon crystals. Analysis of the adiabatic temperature change and magnetic Gruneisen parameter reveals an enhanced magnetocaloric effect near field-induced transitions between these exotic quantum phases. Additionally, we demonstrate that the frustrated spin-1 diamond chain can operate as an efficient working medium of a quantum Stirling engine, which approaches near-optimal efficiency when driven into these unconventional quantum states.",

    "summary": "Elucidating the catalytic descriptor that accurately characterizes the structure-activity relationships of typical catalysts for various important heterogeneous catalytic reactions is pivotal for designing high-efficient catalytic systems. Here, an interpretable machine learning technique was employed to identify the key determinants governing the nitrate reduction reaction ($\\rm NO_3RR$) performance across 286 single-atom catalysts (SACs) with the active sites anchored on double-vacancy $\\rm BC_3$ monolayers. Through Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis with reliable predictive accuracy, we quantitatively demonstrated that, favorable $\\rm NO_3RR$ activity stems from a delicate balance among three critical factors: low $\\rm N_V$, moderate $\\rm D_N$, and specific doping patterns. Building upon these insights, we established a descriptor ($\\psi$) that integrates the intrinsic catalytic properties and the intermediate O-N-H angle ($\\theta$), effectively capturing the underlying structure-activity relationship. Guided by this, we further identified 16 promising catalysts with predicted low limiting potential ($U_{\\rm L}$). Importantly, these catalysts are composed of cost-effective non-precious metal elements and are predicted to surpass most reported catalysts, with the best-performing Ti-V-1N1 is predicted to have an ultra-low $U_{\\rm L}$ of $-0.10$ V.",

Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer $t-J_{\\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed, while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity. Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.",

Aspects of theoretical findings associated with the nature of magnetism and metallicity, in a diverse set of parameter regimes, are now being actively investigated in triangular Hubbard cold atom and solid-state (moir\\'e) based emulators. Building on the theoretical work of Haerter and Shastry [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95,087202 (2005)], we explore the impact of kinetically frustrated magnetism, a phenomenon where antiferromagnetic order emerges without any underlying magnetic interactions, at finite hole density. We numerically study the infinite-$U$ triangular Hubbard model using the density matrix renormalization group algorithm and estimate the extent of stability of the kinetically induced $120^{\\circ}$ antiferromagnetic state to hole doping. Beyond the Haerter-Shastry regime, we find an intermediate phase with multimer (involving multiple correlated spins) stripes that eventually gives way to a paramagnet. We also find evidence of gapless charge excitations (metallicity) throughout the phase diagram for finite hole density. We discuss the implications at large, but finite and realistic values of $U/t$, and investigate whether kinetic magnetism and superexchange collaborate or compete.",

    "summary": "Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion (HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure. Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in complex real-world scenarios.",

A general framework based on elementary algebraic topology and category theory is developed to determine the block structure of reduced density matrices for arbitrary bipartite manifolds on which the states are defined. Within this framework, we scrutinize the impact of topology on the entanglement structure for low-dimensional manifolds, including especially the torus, the Klein bottle, and lens spaces. By further incorporating gauge invariance, we refine our framework to determine the entanglement structure for topological gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, in two dimensions, it is shown for the Kitaev quantum double model that not only the topological entanglement entropy can be reproduced, but also the Li-Haldane conjecture concerning the full entanglement spectrum holds exactly.",

Here we show that their symmetry allows for a switchable ferro-spinetic polarization - the spin analogue of ferroelectricity - in a direction dictated by the lattice symmetry. We demonstrate this effect first in its purest form in an interacting altermagnetic fermion model, in which a many-body chiral symmetry forbids any charge polarization. Our quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal edge-localized, reversible spin accumulations fully consistent with this symmetry locking. Breaking the chiral symmetry releases the charge sector: a ferroelectric polarization emerges orthogonal to the ferro-spinetic one, yielding mutually perpendicular switchable spin- and charge-polarized responses. We identify Mn-based metal-organic frameworks as realistic hosts for this effect, offering a practical route for experimental verification.",

In $1+1$d, we prove that the complexity of subsystems of length $\\ell$ smaller than half grows linearly in time $T$ at least up to $T = \\ell / 4$ but becomes zero after time $T = \\ell /2$ in the limit of a large local dimension, while the complexity of the complementary subsystem of length larger than half grows linearly in time up to exponentially late times.

    "summary": "In isolated quantum many-body systems periodically driven in time, the asymptotic dynamics at late times can exhibit distinct behavior such as thermalization or dynamical freezing. Understanding the properties of and the convergence towards infinite-time (nonequilibrium) steady states however remains a challenging endeavor. We propose a physically motivated Krylov space perspective on Floquet thermalization which offers a natural framework to study rates of convergence towards steady states and, simultaneously, an efficient numerical algorithm to evaluate infinite-time averages of observables within the diagonal ensemble. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to the periodically driven mixed-field Ising model, reaching system sizes of up to 30 spins. Our method successfully resolves the transition between the ergodic and dynamically frozen phases and provides insight into the nature of the Floquet eigenstates across the phase diagram. Furthermore, we show that the long-time behavior is encoded within the localization properties of the Ritz vectors under the Floquet evolution, providing an accurate diagnostic of ergodicity.",

In a recent work [Phys. Rev. X 15, 031065 (2025)], we introduced a new truncation scheme -- here renamed as Renormalized Dual Basis (RDB) -- based on the resolution of the single-plaquette problem, and demonstrated its performance for SU(2) LGTs. In this paper, we apply the RDB to compact quantum electrodynamics (cQED) in three spacetime dimensions (2+1D). We variationally determine the ground state of the theory for small lattices with periodic (for pure gauge) and open (in presence of fermionic matter) boundary conditions, achieving improved precision for the plaquette operator compared to previous approaches. By leveraging tensor networks, we extend the study to larger lattices and demonstrate the scalability of the method. Overall, we show that the RDB provides an efficient description across all coupling regimes.",

    "summary": "We propose a hybrid quantum-classical eigensolver to address the computational challenges of simulating strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, where the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and extensive entanglement render classical methods intractable. Our approach combines real-space sampling of tensor-network-bridged quantum circuits with symmetric subspace measurements, effectively constraining the wavefunction within a substaintially reduced Hilbert space for efficient and scalable simulations of versatile target states. The system is partitioned into equal-sized subsystems, where quantum circuits capture local entanglement and tensor networks reconnect them to recover global correlations, thereby overcoming partition-induced limitations. Symmetric subspace measurements exploit point-group symmetries through a many-to-one mapping that aggregates equivalent real-space configurations into a single symmetric state, effectively enhancing real-space bipartition entanglement while elimilating redundant degrees of freedom. The tensor network further extends this connectivity across circuits, restoring global entanglement and correlation, while simultaneously enabling generative sampling for efficient optimization. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to the periodic $J_1\\!-\\!J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, incorporating translation, reflection, and inversion symmetries. With a small matrix product state bond dimension of up to 6, the method achieves an absolute energy error of $10^{-5}$ for a 64-site periodic chain and a $6\\times6$ torus after bond-dimension extrapolation. These results validate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid eigensolver and demonstrate its strong potential for scalable quantum simulations of strongly correlated systems.",

This challenge becomes especially apparent in molecular-level particle simulations, where high spatial and temporal resolution leads to rapidly increasing computational demands. To overcome these limitations, hybrid methods that combine simulations with different levels of resolution offer a promising solution. In this context, we present a machine learning-based decision model that dynamically selects between simulation methods at runtime. The model is built around a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) that predicts the expected discrepancy between particle and continuum simulation results, enabling the localized use of high-fidelity particle simulations only where they are expected to add value. This concurrent approach is applied to the simulation of membrane fabrication processes, where a particle simulation is coupled with a continuum model. This article describes the architecture of the decision model and its integration into the simulation workflow, enabling efficient, scalable, and adaptive multiscale simulations.",

To investigate its ground-state properties in the intermediate coupling regime which is critical for real materials, we construct a two-orbital bilayer Hubbard model and employ the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method for large-scale simulations. By systematically calculating ground-state pairing correlation functions across parameter spaces, we map its pairing symmetry phase diagram. We find that an increasing Hund's coupling selectively enhances the interlayer $s_{\\pm}$-wave pairing while suppressing the intralayer $d$-wave pairing. Similarly, a larger crystal field splitting drives a transition from $d$-wave- to $s_{\\pm}$-wave-dominant states. Further analysis reveals that the strength of the intralayer $d$-wave pairing is strongly correlated with the $(\\pi, \\pi)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, which are in turn effectively suppressed by a large crystal field splitting, thereby weakening the $d$-wave pairing channel. Additionally, the dominant pairing symmetry transition region roughly overlaps with the inversion of orbital occupancy response to Hubbard $U$, suggesting an intrinsic link between pairing competition and orbital physics. Our results indicate that, within the parameter regime relevant to the actual material, the $s_{\\pm}$-wave is the most probable pairing symmetry.",

We implement this algorithm in our open-source C++ template library, Physica. Combining the improved algorithm with state-of-the-art software engineering, our implementation achieves high performance and numerical stability. As an example, we demonstrate that for the $4 \\times 4$ Hubbard model, our method runs approximately $10^3$ times faster than $\\mathcal{H}\\Phi$ 3.5.2. Moreover, the accessible temperature range is extended down to $\\beta = 32$ across arbitrary doping levels.

The interpretation of experimental RIXS data requires theoretical calculations based on the Kramers-Heisenberg formula. However, due to the dependence of RIXS on both the incident and scattered photon properties, a tractable treatment of the angular dependence in this formula has been lacking. In this work, within the electric dipole approximation, we determine the number of fundamental spectra contributing to the RIXS cross-section for all crystallographic point groups. We then derive a general expression for the RIXS cross-section of isotropic samples such as un-textured powders, homogeneous glasses or liquids, explicitly accounting for the polarization and propagation directions of both the incident and scattered photons. Simplified forms of the RIXS expressions are subsequently obtained for most common point groups.

Since the Peierls distortion arises from the coupling between lattice displacements and itinerant electrons, evaluating the adiabatic forces during time evolution is computationally intensive, particularly for large systems. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop a generalized Behler-Parrinello neural-network architecture -- originally formulated for ab initio molecular dynamics -- to accurately and efficiently predict forces from local structural environments. Using the locality of electronic responses, the resulting ML force field achieves linear scaling efficiency while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Large-scale dynamical simulations using this framework uncover a two-stage coarsening behavior of CDW domains: an early-time regime characterized by a power-law growth $L \\sim t^{\\alpha}$ with an effective exponent $\\alpha \\approx 0.7$, followed by a crossover to the Allen-Cahn scaling $L \\sim \\sqrt{t}$ at late times. The enhanced early-time coarsening is attributed to anisotropic domain-wall motion arising from electron-mediated directional interactions. This work demonstrates the promise of ML-based force fields for multiscale dynamical modeling of condensed-matter lattice models.",

However, the explicit form of the underlying Fokker-Planck equation governing the walker population distribution has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation for AFQMC and propose a novel numerical scheme to solve it. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation reveals the wavefunction actually sampled by the AFQMC algorithm. Interestingly, we find that even when the exact ground state is used as a guiding wavefunction in constrained path AFQMC, contrary to the common assumption, the wavefunction sampled by AFQMC is not exact. Beyond clarifying several fundamental aspects of AFQMC, the availability of a Fokker-Planck equation formulation opens new avenues for systematically improving its accuracy, which we outline in this paper.",

    "summary": "We investigate the weak interaction integer quantum Hall (IQH) phase, the intermediate interaction phase identified as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the transition between them in the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at a density of one electron per site in an orbital magnetic field corresponding to one-quarter flux per plaquette. Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $\\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.",

In contrast, obtaining 2D images, such as from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), is more accessible, though typically providing insufficient information to accurately characterize the 3D microstructure. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that predicts the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images. The presented method utilizes a low-parametric 3D model from stochastic geometry to generate a large number of virtual 3D microstructures and employs a physics-based SEM simulation tool to obtain the corresponding 2D SEM images. By systematically varying the underlying model parameters, a large dataset can be generated to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By doing so, we can statistically reconstruct the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images by drawing realizations from the stochastic 3D model using the predicted model parameters. In addition, we conducted an error analysis on key geometrical descriptors to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of this stereological prediction tool.",

Specifically, we calculate Wigner negativity -- a magic monotone which can be interpreted as a measure of the stabilizer complexity, or equivalently, the complexity of classical simulation -- in various toy models for evaporating black holes. We first calculate the Wigner negativity of Hawking radiation in the PSSY model directly using the gravitational path integral, and show that the negativity is $O(1)$ before the Page transition, but becomes exponentially large past the Page transition. We also derive a universal, information theoretic formula for the negativity which interpolates between the two extremes. We then study the Wigner negativity of radiation in a dynamical model of black hole evaporation. In this case, the negativity shows a sharp spike at early times resulting from the coupling between the black hole and the radiation system, but at late times when the system settles down, we find that the negativity satisfies the same universal formula as in the PSSY model. Finally, we also propose a geometric formula for Wigner negativity in general holographic states using intuition from fixed area states and random tensor networks, and argue that a python's lunch in the entanglement wedge implies a stabilizer complexity which is exponentially large in $\\frac{1}{8G_N}$ times the difference between the areas corresponding to the outermost and minimal extremal surfaces.",

B 111, 125157 (2025)}], and it has been demonstrated that the renormalization effect generated by strong correlations counterintuitively changes the nature of dissipation into an emergent many-body dissipation that causes a Kondo breakdown. In a closely related context, it is also known that two-body loss in a non-Hermitian Kondo model triggers the Kondo breakdown. To elucidate the essence of these phenomena, we study the Anderson impurity model with a non-Hermitian complex hybridization as an effective model that provides a simple understanding of the Kondo breakdown. Using the slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that this model can explain the Kondo breakdown with a single complex parameter. Furthermore, we provide the exact Bethe ansatz solutions that support the results obtained by the slave-boson mean-field theory. Finally, we point out that the Lehmann representation for the non-Hermitian Green function cannot be obtained by the analytic continuation to the complex energy upon the Kondo breakdown, where the analyticity of the non-Hermitian Green function in the half-complex-$\\omega$ plane no longer holds.",

    "summary": "A field-induced quantum spin liquid (QSL) state is an extraordinary phenomenon, hitherto unobserved in metallic frustrated compounds. Recent bulk measurements have revealed intriguing field-induced magnetic states in metallic frustrated CePdAl. However, the nature of these field-induced states, potentially including a QSL state, remains unclear due to the lack of detailed microscopic investigation. To elucidate these field-induced states, we employed the transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-$\\mu$SR) technique, applying various magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in single-crystalline CePdAl over a broad temperature range (100~K-100~mK). Our $\\mu$SR data indicate that field-induced low-temperature states for fields B$\\leq B_{c2}(=3.4~T)$ exhibit long-range magnetic order, whereas for B>$B_{c2}$ they yield contrasting behavior. Notably, at 3.75 T, the transverse relaxation rate ($\\lambda_T$) diverges following a power-law dependence below 800~mK along with an indication of finite frustration, whereas the Knight shift is temperature independent. These observations corroborate the signature of a critical spin-liquid (CSL) with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Furthermore, at 4.3 T, a non-Fermi liquid state is observed where frustration is absent. This comprehensive microscopic study strongly suggests the existence of a CSL state in a metallic frustrated system.",

    "summary": "Tensor-network renormalization group (TNRG) is an efficient real-space renormalization group method for studying the criticality in both classical and quantum lattice systems. Exploiting symmetries of a system in a TNRG algorithm can simplify the implementation of the algorithm and can help produce correct tensor RG flows. Although a general framework for considering a global on-site symmetry has been established, it is still unclear how to incorporate a lattice symmetry like rotation or reflection in TNRG. As a first step for lattice symmetries, we propose a method to incorporate the lattice-reflection symmetry in the context of a TNRG with entanglement filtering in both two and three dimensions (2D and 3D). To achieve this, we write down a general definition of lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network language. Then, we introduce a transposition trick for exploiting and imposing the lattice-reflection symmetry in two basic TNRG operators: projective truncations and entanglement filtering. Using the transposition trick, the detailed algorithms of the TNRG map in both 2D and 3D are laid out, where the lattice-reflection symmetry is preserved and imposed. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct the linearization of the TNRG maps in a given lattice-reflection sector, with the help of which it becomes possible to extract scaling dimensions in each sector separately. Our work paves the way for understanding the lattice-rotation symmetry in TNRG.",

    "summary": "A multichannel Kondo system, where a single quantum spin couples to multiple channels of an electronic bath, provides one of the simplest examples of a zero-dimensional non-Fermi liquid. It is natural to ask: what happens when an extensive number of such systems are coupled together? A simple renormalization group argument implies that in a chain of SU(N) multichannel quantum systems, where each spin is coupled to its own bath of K channels, the individual spins dynamically decouple at low energy when N>K, resulting in a 'sliding' non-Fermi liquid. Using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we find evidences of a continuous, 'dimensionality-changing' phase transition out of this non-Fermi liquid into a valence-bond solid phase as the intersite coupling is increased. Remarkably, at the critical point, correlations exhibit a power-law behavior even along the direction in which the spins are coupled, indicating the breakdown of dynamical decoupling at the transition. We also develop an RG scheme to understand the universal aspects of this transition.",

    "summary": "We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian -- incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability, and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.",

As a quantitative measure of stability, we compute the magnon binding energy $E_{\\rm b}(M,p)$ for bound clusters of size $p$ over wide ranges of the frustration ratio $J_2/|J_1|$ and the normalized magnetization $M/M_{\\rm s}$. Near saturation, we benchmark our data against the analytic two-magnon result and map out a clear hierarchy of $p$-magnon states, whose phase boundaries follow an empirical scaling $J_{2,{\\rm c}}(p;p\\!+\\!1)/|J_1|\\!\\approx\\!0.34\\,p^{-2.3}$ for large $p$. We further quantify the relation between the most stable $p$ and the zero-field pitch angle $\\theta$, verifying the conjectured inequality $1/p>\\theta/\\pi>1/(p+1)$ up to $p \\lesssim 9$. The binding energy shows pronounced suppression as $J_2/|J_1|\\!\\to\\!1/4^+$ and, for some frustration values, attains a maximum below full saturation, indicating that partial depolarization enhances bound-magnon mobility. Close to the FM instability, $E_{\\rm b}(M_{\\rm s},p)$ exhibits an empirical power-law vanishing consistent with a quantum-Lifshitz scenario. Our results provide a comprehensive, experimentally relevant map of MBS stability across field and frustration, offering concrete guidance for inelastic probes in quasi-one-dimensional magnets.",

    "summary": "Since the advent of various pre-trained large language models, extracting structured knowledge from scientific text has experienced a revolutionary change compared with traditional machine learning or natural language processing techniques. Despite these advances, accessible automated tools that allow users to construct, validate, and visualise datasets from scientific literature extraction remain scarce. We therefore developed ComProScanner, an autonomous multi-agent platform that facilitates the extraction, validation, classification, and visualisation of machine-readable chemical compositions and properties, integrated with synthesis data from journal articles for comprehensive database creation. We evaluated our framework using 100 journal articles against 10 different LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, to extract highly complex compositions associated with ceramic piezoelectric materials and corresponding piezoelectric strain coefficients (d33), motivated by the lack of a large dataset for such materials. DeepSeek-V3-0324 outperformed all models with a significant overall accuracy of 0.82. This framework provides a simple, user-friendly, readily-usable package for extracting highly complex experimental data buried in the literature to build machine learning or deep learning datasets.",

Wang et al., arXiv:2507.22971), we studied a microscopic time-reversal symmetric model of tunable interacting Chern bands using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and presented evidence for the emergence of robust skyrmion excitations. These charged excitations emerge in the vicinity of a many-body insulator at a commensurate filling of the Chern bands, and lead to the onset of superconductivity when doped away from the insulating phase. Here, we present quantum Monte-Carlo results and a complementary field-theoretical analysis for the quantum phase transition(s) that arise between the intertwined phases as a function of two distinct tuning parameters. Our numerical results are consistent with a single continuous quantum phase transition between an insulating Chern antiferromagnet and a fully gapped superconductor, with an emergent SO(5) symmetry at the putative critical point, highly suggestive of deconfined quantum (pseudo-)criticality. We also present a detailed comparison between the momentum-resolved spectral functions associated with the neutral collective modes, single electron and composite spin-polaron excitations obtained using a combination of Monte-Carlo computations and a Bethe-Salpeter analysis built on top of the self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculation. We end with a brief outlook on some of the interesting open problems.",

The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.",

The key idea is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map, so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor. TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular, both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP. On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training across local cohorts.",

In this model, we consider two kinds of nearest-neighbor interaction (intra-hexagon interaction $J_1$ and inter-hexagon $J_2$) and the selected third nearest-neighbor interaction $J_3$ along $x$ direction. From our calculations, there are five phases in the parameters regime $0<\\lambda_1=J_2/J_1<4, 0<\\lambda_2=J_3/J_1<4$, including a N\\'eel antiferromagentic phase, a Haldane-like symmetry protected topological phase, a hexagon phase and two dimer phases. In the Haldane-like SPT phase, we characterized its topological nature using the degeneracy of ground-state energy under open boundary condition and the entanglement spectrum. To characterize the phase boundaries, we use spin stiffness and Binder cumulant to do the comprehensive finite-size scalings. From data collapse, the critical behaviors of all the nonmagnetic phases to the antiferromagnetic phase belong to the 3D $O(3)$ Heisenberg universality class. As a theoretical exploration, our work establishes a foundational framework for understanding 2D magnetism on the SHO lattice.",

    "summary": "Spins in solid-state materials, molecules, and other chemical systems have the potential to impact the fields of quantum sensing, communication, simulation, and computing. In particular, color centers in diamond, such as negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^-$) and silicon vacancy centers (SiV$^-$), are emerging as quantum platforms poised for transition to commercial devices. A key enabler stems from the semiconductor-like platform that can be tailored at the time of growth. The large growth parameter space makes it challenging to use intuition to optimize growth conditions for quantum performance. In this paper, we use supervised machine learning to train regression models using different synthesis parameters in over 100 quantum diamond samples. We train models to optimize NV$^-$ defects in diamond for high sensitivity magnetometry. Importantly, we utilize a magnetic-field sensitivity figure of merit (FOM) for NV magnetometry and use Bayesian optimization to identify critical growth parameters that lead to a 300% improvement over an average sample and a 55% improvement over the previous champion sample. Furthermore, using Shapley importance rankings, we gain new physical insights into the most impactful growth and post-processing parameters, namely electron irradiation dose, diamond seed depth relative to the plasma, seed miscut angle, and reactor nitrogen concentration. As various quantum devices can have significantly different material requirements, advanced growth techniques such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) can provide the ability to tailor material development specifically for quantum applications.",

By specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\\delta$.

In this work, we introduce a variational framework that leverages matrix product states for the efficient classical evaluation of the Helmholtz free energy, combining scalable entanglement entropy computation with a hardware efficient ansatz to accurately approximate thermal states in one- and two-dimensional systems. We conduct extensive benchmarking on key observables, including energy density, susceptibility, specific heat, and two-point correlations, comparing against exact analytical results for 1D systems and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for 2D lattices across various temperatures and ansatz configurations. Our large-scale numerical simulations demonstrate the capability to prepare high-quality Gibbs states for 1D lattice models with up to 30 sites and 2D systems with up to 6x6 sites, using up to 42 qubits. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor by preparing the approximate Gibbs state of a 30-site transverse-field Ising model. Leveraging a combination of error mitigation techniques, we reduce the relative errors in energy and susceptibility measurements by over 50% compared to unmitigated results.",

Consequently, we generalize the CTMRG to the hyperbolic dodecahedral lattice, which is an infinite-dimensional lattice. We analyze the spontaneous magnetization, von Neumann entropy, and correlation length to find a continuous non-critical phase transition on the dodecahedral lattice. The phase transition temperature is estimated to be $T_{\\rm pt} \\approx 4.66$. We find the magnetic critical exponents $\\beta= 0.4999$ and $\\delta=3.007$ that confirm the mean-field universality class in accord with predictions of Monte Carlo and high-temperature series expansions.

    "summary": "The use of magnetic nanographenes as building blocks for artificial spin lattices is enabling the exploration of flagship model Hamiltonians of one-dimensional quantum magnetism with an unprecedented degree of control. The spin-1 Heisenberg model, incorporating both linear and quadratic exchange interactions, was first realized using [3]-triangulenes, where the hallmark Haldane phase with spin fractionalization was observed. Later, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian with exchange alternation was realized with Clar's goblets, where two additional topological phases were identified. Here we show that spin-1 nanographenes can also be used to explore the topological phase transition between the Haldane phase and a dimerized phase predicted for spin-1 chains with bond-alternation. We first study how the boundary of the phase transition is modified by non-linear exchange, known to be present in spin-1 nanographenes, using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Combining multiconfigurational with first-principles calculations, we propose two candidates to realize different topological phases of the model: a recently synthesized extended Clar's goblet, and a passivated [4]-triangulene. Moreover, we show how these two phases can be identified experimentally using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). This work paves the way for the experimental realization of these topological phases, which can be locally probed with scanning tunneling microscopy.",

Nevertheless, the recovery of local details in the reconstructed tensor still leaves scope for enhancement. In this paper, we propose efficient tensor completion model that incorporates trace regularization within the FCTN decomposition framework. The trace regularization is constructed based on the mode-$k$ unfolding of the FCTN factors combined with periodically modified negative laplacian. The trace regularization promotes the smoothness of the FCTN factors through discrete second-order derivative penalties, thereby enhancing the continuity and local recovery performance of the reconstructed tensor. To solve the proposed model, we develop an efficient algorithm within the proximal alternating minimization (PAM) framework and theoretically prove its convergence. To reduce the runtime of the proposed algorithm, we design an intermediate tensor reuse mechanism that can decrease runtime by 10\\%-30\\% without affecting image recovery, with more significant improvements for larger-scale data. A comprehensive complexity analysis reveals that the mechanism attains a reduced computational complexity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.",

Deviations from the classical description due to the quantum nature of the atomic spins as well as quantum fluctuations are usually treated as negligible if long-range order is preserved, and are rarely quantified for actual materials. Here, we demonstrate that a fully quantum-mechanical framework is required for a quantitatively correct description of the spin-flop transition in the insulating altermagnet hematite between the collinear antiferromagnetic and the weakly ferromagnetic spin-flop phase at low temperature. By applying both exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group theory to the quantum Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we show how a quantum-mechanical treatment of an ab initio parametrized spin model can significantly improve the predicted low-temperature spin-flop field over a classical description when compared to measurements. Our results imply that quantum fluctuations have a measurable influence on selecting the ground state of a system out of competing ordered magnetic phases at low temperature.",

    "summary": "Numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to the understanding of dynamical systems. Standard approaches involving time-stepping schemes compute the solution at each time step, which becomes too costly when simulating long-term dynamics. Alternatively, space-time methods that treat the combined space-time domain simultaneously promise better stability and accuracy. Interestingly, data-driven approaches for learning and predicting dynamics, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), also employ a combined space-time representation. However, the curse of dimensionality often limits the practical benefits of space-time methods. In this work, we investigate quantum-inspired methods for space-time approaches, both for solving PDEs and for making DMD predictions. We achieve this goal by treating both spatial and temporal dimensions within a single matrix product state (MPS) encoding. First, we benchmark our MPS space-time solver for both linear and nonlinear PDEs, observing that the MPS ansatz accurately captures the underlying spatio-temporal correlations while having significantly fewer degrees of freedom. Second, we develop an MPS-DMD algorithm to make accurate long-term predictions of nonlinear systems, with runtime scaling logarithmically in both spatial and temporal resolution. This research highlights the role of tensor networks in developing effective and interpretable models, bridging the gap between numerical methods and data-driven approaches.",

    "summary": "The accurate prediction of ionization potentials (IPs) is central to understanding molecular reactivity, redox behavior, and spectroscopic properties. While vertical IPs can be accessed directly from electronic excitations at fixed nuclear geometries, the computation of adiabatic IPs requires nuclear gradients of the ionized states, posing a major theoretical and computational challenge, especially within correlated frameworks. Among the most promising approaches for IP calculations is the many-body Green's function $GW$ method, which provides a balanced compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, it is applicable to both finite and extended systems. Recent work has established formal connections between $GW$ and coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) theory, leading to the first derivation of analytic $GW$ nuclear gradients via a unitary CCD framework. In this work, we present an alternative, fully analytic formulation of $GW$ nuclear gradients based on a modified version of the traditional equation-of-motion CCD formalism, enabling the inclusion of missing correlation effects in the traditional CCD methods.",

    "summary": "Atomistic simulation methods have evolved through successive computational levels, each building upon more fundamental approaches: from quantum mechanics to density functional theory (DFT), and subsequently, to machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While universal MLIPs (u-MLIPs) offer broad transferability, their computational overhead limits large-scale applications. Task-specific MLIPs (ts-MLIPs) achieve superior efficiency but require prohibitively expensive DFT data generation for each material system. In this paper, we propose LightPFP, a data-efficient knowledge distillation framework. Instead of using costly DFT calculations, LightPFP generates a distilled ts-MLIP by leveraging u-MLIP to generate high-quality training data tailored for specific materials and utilizing a pre-trained light-weight MLIP to further enhance data efficiency. Across a broad spectrum of materials, including solid-state electrolytes, high-entropy alloys, and reactive ionic systems, LightPFP delivers three orders of magnitude faster model development than conventional DFT-based methods, while maintaining accuracy on par with first-principles predictions. Moreover, the distilled ts-MLIPs further sustain the computational efficiency essential for large-scale molecular dynamics, achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude faster inference than u-MLIPs. The framework further enables efficient precision transfer learning, where systematic errors from the u-MLIP can be corrected using as few as 10 high-accuracy DFT data points, as demonstrated for MgO melting point prediction. This u-MLIP-driven distillation approach enables rapid development of high-fidelity, efficient MLIPs for materials science applications.",

    "summary": "Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic* time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs, this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models. Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become *efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.",

    "summary": "Understanding the emergence of novel collective behaviors in strongly interacting systems lies at the heart of quantum many-body physics. Valuable insight comes from examining how few-body correlations manifest in many-body systems, embodying the ``from few to many'' philosophy. An intriguing example is the set of universal relations in ultracold atomic gases, which connect a wide range of observables to a single quantity known as the contact. In this Letter, we demonstrate that universal relations manifest in a distinct class of quantum many-body systems, long-range quantum spin chains, which belong to a completely new universality class. Using effective field theory and the operator product expansion, we establish connections between the asymptotic behavior of equal-time spin correlation functions, the dynamical structure factor, and the contact density. The theoretical predictions for equal-time correlators are explicitly verified through numerical simulations based on matrix product states. Our results could be readily tested in state-of-the-art trapped-ion systems.",

High training costs, energy use, and limited device deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation, low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to 93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware AI architectures.",

There are, however, some limitations in what can be treated with these potentials because of gaps in the underlying training data. To extend these capabilities, we introduce AQCat25, a complementary dataset of 13.5 million density functional theory (DFT) single point calculations designed to improve the treatment of systems where spin polarization and/or higher fidelity are critical. We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets, such as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create spin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability. We find that directly tuning a general model on AQCat25 leads to catastrophic forgetting of the original dataset's knowledge. Conversely, joint training strategies prove effective for improving accuracy on the new data without sacrificing general performance. This joint approach introduces a challenge, as the model must learn from a dataset containing both mixed-fidelity calculations and mixed-physics (spin-polarized vs. unpolarized). We show that explicitly conditioning the model on this system-specific metadata, for example by using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), successfully addresses this challenge and further enhances model accuracy. Ultimately, our work establishes an effective protocol for bridging DFT fidelity domains to advance the predictive power of foundational models in catalysis.",

It is known that this inter-layer coupling is marginal and that the bulk critical behavior belongs to the Ashkin-Teller (AT) universality class, as the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model. In this work, the surface critical behavior is studied numerically by Tensor Renormalization-Group calculations. The Bond-Weight Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm is extended to tackle systems with boundaries. It is observed that the two-fold degeneracy of the surface magnetic scaling dimension of the AT model is lifted in the frustrated two-layer Ising model (F2LIM). The splitting is explained by the breaking of the ${\\mathbb Z}_2$-symmetry under spin reversal of a single Ising replica in the F2LIM. The two distinct surface magnetic scaling dimensions $x_1^s$ and $x_2^s$ of the F2LIM satisfies a simple duality relation $x_1^s=1/4x_2^s$.",

A pinched geometry refers to a configuration with an infinitely long temporal extent, even when the total spacetime area is fixed. We examine several choices of integration measures and triangulations to study whether such geometries can dominate in the limit of infinitely many triangles. Our results indicate that pinched geometries are strongly suppressed, and this suppression is observed across different integral measures and triangulations. These results suggest the possible emergence of smooth geometries as well as a sort of universality for infinitely many triangles.",

    "summary": "Spin ice systems represent a prime example of constrained spin systems and exhibit rich low-energy physics. In this study, we explore how introducing a tunable anisotropic spin coupling to the conventional Ising spin ice Hamiltonian on the breathing pyrochlore lattice affects the ground state properties of the system. Significant changes are observed in the ground state structure, reflected in the spin structure factor and in a reduction of residual entropy at low temperatures. We theoretically uncover a rich phase diagram by varying the anisotropy and demonstrate how this modification reduces the ground state degeneracy across different phases. Numerical simulations reveal that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the system either undergoes a crossover into a constrained spin ice manifold, characterized by an entropy density that drops below the Pauling entropy of conventional spin ice, or a phase transition into a symmetry-broken state, depending on the perturbations. Additionally, we compute the spin structure factors for the anisotropic model and compare these results to analytical predictions from a large-$N$ expansion, finding good agreement. This work develops the understanding of spin ice in anisotropic limits, which may be experimentally realized by strain, providing, among others, key signatures in entropy and specific heat.",

In this work, we introduce a scalable Pauli propagation approach that evolves local observables directly in the Heisenberg picture. Theoretically, we derive a priori error bounds governed by the Operator Stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy (OSE) $\\mathcal{S}^\\alpha(O)$, which explicitly links the truncation accuracy to operator complexity and prescribes a suitable Top-$K$ truncation strategy. For the 1D Heisenberg model with $J_z = 0$, we prove the number of non-zero Pauli coefficients scales quadratically in Trotter steps, establishing the compressibility of Heisenberg-evolved operators. Numerically, we validate the framework on XXZ Heisenberg chain benchmarks, showing high accuracy with small $K$ in free regimes ($J_z = 0$) and competitive performance against tensor-network methods (e.g., TDVP) in interacting cases ($J_z = 0.5$). These results establish an observable-centric simulator whose cost is governed by operator complexity rather than entanglement, offering a practical alternative for studying non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems.",

Here, we present a first-principles investigation of magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of the form XY$_4$Z$_8$ (X $=$ Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, or V; Y $=$ Nb or Ta; and Z $=$ Se or S), identifying a subset of new versatile AM candidates. Our results establish a direct correlation between interatomic geometry, quantified by the ratio of interlayer to intralayer spacing, and the selection of magnetic ground states. Systems with A-type antiferromagnetic order exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting consistent with AM behavior. Crucially, the combination of the AM spin-splitting and the spin-orbit coupling leads to the emergence of Weyl nodes together with the corresponding topological Fermi arc surface states. Moreover, we identify flat bands near the Fermi level that originate from the intercalant-induced formation of an effective kagome-like sublattice in the TMD layer. These results collectively establish magnetically intercalated TMDs as a promising platform for engineering altermagnetism, flat bands, and Weyl fermions within a single material family, facilitating the development of topological and spintronic applications.",

Understanding how its computational complexity relates to underlying dynamics is crucial for both theoretical insight and practical utility, yet remains largely unexplored despite a few case studies. Here, we address this question for a family of brickwork quantum circuits ranging from integrable to chaotic regimes. Using tools from geometric group theory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal entanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources required for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these models. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish between classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain examples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings without an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an operational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and discuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations. Our results establish a new connection between quantum many-body dynamics and group theory, providing fresh insights into the complexity of the IM and its intricate connection to the physical characteristics of the dynamics.",

We uncover a sharp transition in the entanglement dynamics as a function of the driving frequency. For large drive periods $T$, we observe a linear growth in entanglement entropy (EE), indicating a heating phase with volume law entanglement. Surprisingly, for driving periods below a critical value $T_\\ast$, the EE grows subextensively with time, characteristic of a local quantum quench. In the non-interacting limit, we analytically trace the origin of this phenomenon to a transition in the single-particle Floquet quasi-energy spectrum. We also find that for $T>T_*$, the so-called ``average energy\" operator develops non-local, rainbow-like couplings that are responsible for the rapid entanglement growth in the heating phase, but remains local for $T<T_*$. Using extensive matrix-product-state simulations, we show that the non-heating phase and the subextensive entanglement growth persist in the presence of weak interactions for numerically accessible timescales. Our results establish that local Floquet engineering can generate emergent bulk phenomena, shedding new light on energy localization and thermalization in driven many-body systems.",

    "summary": "Neutron irradiation produces, within a few picoseconds, displacement cascades that are sequences of atomic collisions generating point and extended defects which subsequently affects the long-term evolution of materials. The diversity of these defects, characterized morphologically and statistically, defines what is called the \"primary damage\". In this work, we present a fully unsupervised machine learning (ML) workflow that detects and classifies these defects directly from molecular dynamics data. Local environments are encoded by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) vector, anomalous atoms are isolated with autoencoder neural networks (AE), embedded with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). Applied to 80 keV displacement cascades in Ni, Fe$_7$0Ni$_{10}$Cr$_{20}$, and Zr, the AE successfully identify the small fraction of outlier atoms that participate in defect formation. HDBSCAN then partitions the UMAP latent space of AE-flagged SOAP descriptors into well defined groups representing vacancy- and interstitial-dominated regions and, within each, separates small from large aggregates, assigning 99.7 % of outliers to compact physical motifs. A signed cluster-identification score confirms this separation, and cluster size scales with net defect counts (R2 > 0.89). Statistical cross analyses between the ML outlier map and several conventional detectors (centrosymmetry, dislocation extraction, etc.) reveal strong overlap and complementary coverage, all achieved without template or threshold tuning. This ML workflow thus provides an efficient tool for the quantitative mapping of structural anomalies in materials, particularly those arising from irradiation damage in displacement cascades.",

    "summary": "Understanding non-equilibrium spin transport through 2D ferromagnets is a theoretical challenge, as correlations produce a complex electronic structure with coexisting itinerant and localized electrons. We have developed a fully non-equilibrium ab initio method, combining density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory, and non-equilibrium Green's functions to investigate the transport in Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, a prototypical high-temperature 2D ferromagnet. We show that, while spin transport remains essentially single-particle under moderate bias, inelastic spin-dependent scattering of carriers with particle-hole excitations drives a distinctive hot-correlated electron regime beyond a critical voltage. This regime is marked by incoherent features in both the electronic spectrum and the conductance, which are experimentally accessible. Our results demonstrates that material-specific many-body non-equilibrium methods are essential for a complete understanding of spin transport in 2D ferromagnets.",

    "summary": "Proper treatment of the many-body interactions is of paramount importance in our understanding of strongly correlated systems. Here we investigate the effects of particle-hole fluctuations on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in two-dimensional Fermi gases throughout the entire BCS-BEC crossover. We include self-consistently in the self energy treatment the entire particle-hole $T$ matrix, which constitutes a renormalization of the bare interaction that appears in the particle-particle scattering $T$ matrix, leading to a screening of the pairing interaction and hence a dramatic reduction of the pairing gap and the transition temperature. The BKT transition temperature $T_\\text{BKT}$ is determined by the critical phase space density, for which the pair density and pair mass are determined using a pairing fluctuation theory, which accommodates self-consistently the important self-energy feedback in the treatment of finite-momentum pairing fluctuations. The screening strength varies continuously from its maximum in the BCS limit to essentially zero in BEC limit. In the unitary regime, it leads to an interaction-dependent shift of $T_\\text{BKT}$ towards the BEC regime. This shift is crucial in an attempt to explain experimental data quantitatively, which often depends on the interaction strength. Our findings are consistent with available experimental results in the unitary and BEC regimes and with quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the BCS and unitary regimes.",

Here we consider the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice describing the hole-doped moir\\'e superlattice emerging in WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer in the moderately correlated regime. By applying the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, we diagonalize the spin-valley-polarized Hamiltonian and show signatures of coexisting singlet and triplet pairings in the range of hole dopings and displacement fields reported in the experiments. In this view, we show that the superconductivity in the WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer is likely to be induced by electronic correlations and has a mixed-symmetry character. These predictions can shed light on the nature of the superconducting state observed in the twisted homobilayer of WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$. We also identify the emerging superconducting orders, which are $d_{xy}(d_{x^2-y^2} \\pm id_{xy} )$ and $p_y(p_{x}\\mp ip_{y})$ for the singlet and triplet channels in the cylinder of width three(four), respectively.",

Our time-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering measurements at the upper Hubbard band reveal a gapless collective excitation dispersing from the charge-order wavevector up to 0.8 eV with a slope on the order of the quasiparticle velocity. These findings reveal a regime where correlated carriers acquire itinerant character at finite momentum, and charge order becomes dynamically fluctuating, offering a platform to explore light-induced pairing instabilities.",

    "summary": "Engineering van Hove singularities (vHss) near the Fermi level, if feasible, offers a powerful route to control exotic quantum phases in electronic and magnetic behaviors. However, conventional approaches, which rely primarily on chemical and electrical doping, focus mainly on local electrical or optical measurements, limiting their applicability to coupled functionalities. In this study, a vHs-induced insulator-metal transition coupled with a ferromagnetic phase transition was empirically achieved in atomically designed quasi-2D SrRuO3 (SRO) superlattices via epitaxial strain engineering, which has not been observed in conventional 3D SRO systems. Theoretical calculations revealed that epitaxial strain effectively modulates the strength and energy positions of vHs of specific Ru orbitals, driving correlated phase transitions in the electronic and magnetic ground states. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the anisotropic electronic structure of quasi-2D SRO modulated by epitaxial strain. Magneto-optic Kerr effect and electrical transport measurements demonstrated modulated magnetic and electronic phases. Furthermore, magneto-electrical measurements detected significant anomalous Hall effect signals and ferromagnetic magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of magnetically coupled charge carriers in the 2D metallic regime. This study establishes strain engineering as a promising platform for tuning vHss and resultant itinerant ferromagnetism of low-dimensional correlated quantum systems.",

    "summary": "Sampling problems have emerged as a central avenue for demonstrating quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, physical noise can fundamentally alter their computational complexity, often making them classically tractable. Motivated by the recent success of matrix product state (MPS)-based classical simulation of Gaussian boson sampling (Oh et al., 2024), we extend this framework to investigate the classical simulability of other noisy quantum sampling models. We develop MPS-based classical algorithms for lossy boson sampling and noisy instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) sampling, both of which retain the tunable accuracy characteristic of the MPS approach through the bond dimension. Our approach constructs pure-state decompositions of noisy or lossy input states whose components remain weakly entangled after circuit evolution, thereby providing a means to systematically explore the boundary between quantum-hard and classically-simulable regimes. For boson sampling, we analyze single-photon, Fock, and cat-state inputs, showing that classical simulability emerges at transmission rates scaling as $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$, reaching the known boundary of quantum advantage with a tunable and scalable method. Beyond reproducing previous thresholds, our algorithm offers significantly improved control over the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. It further extends the applicability of MPS-based simulation to broader classes of noisy quantum sampling models, including IQP circuits.",

The logic applies to regions with sharp corners, from which we derive several universal properties regarding corner entanglement. These universal properties follow from a set of locally-checkable conditions on the wavefunction. We also define a quantity $(\\mathfrak{c}_{\\text{tot}})_{\\text{min}}$ that reflects the robustness of corner entanglement contributions, and show that it provides an obstruction to a gapped boundary. One reward from our analysis is that we can construct a local gapped Hamiltonian within the same chiral gapped phase from a given wavefunction; we conjecture that it is closer to the low-energy renormalization group fixed point than the original parent Hamiltonian. Our analysis of corner entanglement reveals the emergence of a universal conformal geometry encoded in the entanglement structure of bulk regions of chiral gapped states that is not visible in topological field theory.",

    "summary": "A key challenge for quantum computers is the efficient preparation of many-body entangled states across many qubits. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of matrix product states (MPS) using a renormalization-group(RG)-based quantum algorithm on superconducting quantum hardware. Compared to sequential generation, it has been shown that the RG-based protocol asymptotically prepares short-range correlated MPS with an exponentially shallower circuit depth (when scaling system size), but it is not yet clear for which system sizes it starts to convey an advantage. We thus apply this algorithm to prepare a class of MPS exhibiting a phase transition between a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) and a trivial phase for systems of up to 80 qubits. We find that the reduced depth of the RG-based circuits makes them more resilient to noise, and that they generally outperform the sequential circuits for large systems, as we showcase by measuring string-order-like local expectation values and energy densities. We thus demonstrate that the RG-based protocol enables large-scale preparation of MPS and, in particular, SPT-ordered states beyond the fixed point.",

    "summary": "This study investigates the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in pyrochlore oxides with non-Kramers ions, driven by structural randomness that effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing quantum fluctuations on top of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation that disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins with their local environment. Given this unusual situation, it is essential to assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. To perform this study, a minimal model for disordered quantum spin ice, the transverse-field Ising model, is analyzed using a formulation of gauge mean-field theory (GMFT) directly in real space. This approach allows the inclusion of disorder effects exactly and provides access to non-perturbative effects. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. Moreover, the Griffiths region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations appears tiny and restricted to the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the uniqueness of the low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well, indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its homogeneous counterpart.",

However, their scalability is inherently constrained by exponential memory and computational overhead, which restricts accurate simulation of large-scale quantum circuits and often results in approximate output distributions. Here, we propose an exact sampling algorithm that integrates tensor network contraction techniques with a Markov process, wherein a classical state evolves according to the local structure of the quantum circuit. As a demonstration, we target the challenge of generating samples from ideal and noisy QAOA circuits with up to 476 qubits, incorporating both depolarizing and amplitude damping noise models. These results enable further validation of several assumptions and conjectures at a scale previously out of reach, significantly expanding the scope of classical simulation in quantum algorithm research.",

In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates. These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians. Motivated by earlier works on Hamiltonians with QMBS, in this work we formalize the differences between three distinct types of parent Hamiltonians, which differ in their decompositions into strictly local terms with the same eigenstates. We illustrate this classification using the $W$ state as the primary example, for which we rigorously derive the complete set of local parent Hamiltonians, which also allows us to establish general results such as the existence of asymptotic QMBS, and distinct dynamical signatures associated with the different parent Hamiltonian types. Finally, we derive more general results on the parent Hamiltonian types that allow us to obtain some immediate results for simple quantum states such as product states, where only a single type exists, and for short-range-entangled states, for which we identify constraints on the admissible types. Altogether, our work opens the door to classifying the rich structures and dynamical properties of parent Hamiltonians that arise from the interplay between locality and QMBS.",

The technique uses a combinatorial microwave-optical pump-probe scheme, leveraging both the high-energy resolution of microwaves and the high-efficiency detection using optical photons. In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a continuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse widths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in Y3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the characteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their relative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and coherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse of 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate, corresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle. Our results show that time-dependent strobe light measurement of magnetization dynamics can be achieved in the gigahertz frequency range under a pump-probe detection scheme.",

For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of \"ideal\" (disorder free) overdoped cuprates.",

By analyzing the reduced density matrix of the subsystem located in between the fermion and antifermion, we demonstrate that as the interfermion separation approaches the string-breaking distance, the overlap between the microscopic density matrix and an effective thermal density matrix exhibits a pronounced, narrow peak, approaching unity at the onset of string breaking. This behavior reveals that the confining flux tube evolves toward a genuinely thermal state as the separation between the charges grows, even in the absence of an external heat bath. In other words, one cannot tell whether a reduced state of the subsystem arises from a surrounding heat bath or from entanglement with the rest of the system. The entanglement spectrum near the critical string-breaking distance exhibits a rapid transition from the dominance of a single state describing the confining electric string towards a strongly entangled state containing virtual fermion-antifermion pairs. Our findings establish a quantitative link between confinement, entanglement, and emergent thermality, and suggest that string breaking corresponds to a microscopic thermalization transition within the flux tube.",

    "summary": "A paradigmatic model, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory exhibits confinement mediated by the gauge field that binds pairs of particles into mesons, drawing connections to quantum chromodynamics. In the absence of any additional attractive interactions between particles, mesons are not known to bind in this model. Here, we show that resonant pair-production terms give rise to an additional repulsive binding mechanism that forms a stable ``hadron'' bound state of two mesons. A high-energy state, the hadron is stabilized by being off-resonantly coupled to a continuum. We study the dynamical formation of this bound state starting from local excitations. We use matrix product state techniques based on the time-evolving block decimation algorithm to perform our numerical simulations and analyze the effect of model parameters on hadron formation. Furthermore, we derive an effective model that explains its formation. Our findings are amenable to experimental observation on modern quantum hardware from superconducting qubits to trapped ions.",

Here, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials within the LATTE framework to simulate these materials with near experimental accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost compared to previous computational studies. Our molecular dynamics simulations based on the trained MLIPs reproduce energies and forces across multiple phases, enabling large scale simulations that capture cubic tetragonal orthorhombic transitions, lattice parameters, and octahedral tilting with unprecedented resolution. We find that Pb based perovskites exhibit larger octahedral tilts and higher phase transition temperatures than Sn based analogues, reflecting stronger bonding and enhanced structural stability, whereas Sn based perovskites display reduced tilts and lower barriers, suggesting tunability through compositional or interface engineering. Beyond these systems, our work demonstrates that MLIPs can bridge first principles accuracy with simulation efficiency, providing a robust framework for exploring phase stability, anharmonicity, and rational design in next generation halide perovskites.",

    "summary": "Oxide-water interfaces govern a wide range of physical and chemical processes fundamental to many fields like catalysis, geochemistry, corrosion, electrochemistry, and sensor technology. Near solid oxide surfaces, water behaves differently than in the bulk, exhibiting pronounced structuring and increased reactivity, typically requiring ab initio-level accuracy for reliable modeling. However, explicit ab initio calculations are often computationally prohibitive, especially if large system sizes and long simulation time scales are required. By learning the potential energy surface (PES) from data obtained from electronic structure calculations, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have emerged as transformative tools, enabling simulations with ab initio accuracy at dramatically reduced computational expense. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in the application of MLPs to atomistic simulations of oxide-water interfaces. Specifically, we review insights that have been gained into the reactivity of interfacial systems involving the dissociation and recombination of water molecules, proton transfer processes between the solvent and the surface and the dynamic nature of aqueous oxide surfaces. Moreover, we discuss open challenges and future possible research directions in this rapidly evolving but challenging field.",

This makes a proper understanding of finite-circumference effects crucial for reliably extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit. Using matrix product states, we investigate these effects for the Laughlin-1/2 phase in the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model, which can be viewed as the lattice discretization of the bosonic quantum Hall problem in the continuum. We propose a scaling of the model's parameters with the cylinder circumference that simultaneously approaches the continuum and thermodynamic limits. We find that different scaling schemes yield distinct topological signatures: we either retrieve a spontaneous formation of charge density wave ordering reminiscent of the Tao-Thouless states, known from the continuum problem on thin cylinders, or we find uniform states with a topological degeneracy that can be identified as minimally entangled states known from studies of chiral spin liquids on cylinders. Finally, we carry out a similar analysis of the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase in the same model. Our results clarify the role of symmetries in numerical studies of topologically ordered states on cylinders and highlight the role of lattice effects.",

    "summary": "We investigate the phases and phase-transitions in one-dimensional alternating mixed-spin (1/2-1) chain in the presence of both frustration and anisotropy. Frustration is introduced via next-nearest-neighbor interactions, while single-ion anisotropy is incorporated at each lattice site. Our results show that moderate frustration can drive a phase transition from a ferrimagnetic state to an anti-ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, the presence of a weak easy-plane anisotropy destabilizes the ferrimagnetic order, also leading to the emergence of an antiferromagnetic phase. Interestingly, under strong frustration and anisotropy, the system exhibits signatures of a novel phase with spin density wave (SDW)-like modulation . We explore these anomalous phase transitions by employing exact diagonalization (ED) for small system sizes and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to characterize ground state properties for larger system sizes. We also investigate the finite-temperature behavior across various phases using the ancilla-based time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) approach. The primary objective of this work is to elucidate the phase structure of alternating mixed-spin chains under the combined effects of frustration and anisotropy. The primary objective of this work is to elucidate the intricate interplay between frustration and anisotropy in identifying the exotic phases and phase-transitions in alternating mixed-spin chains. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of mixed-spin quantum systems and may offer insights for future theoretical and experimental studies.",

These discoveries were heavily driven by Migdal-\\'{E}liashberg theory (and its first-principles computational implementations) for electron-phonon interactions, the key concept of phonon-mediated superconductivity. Dozens of predictions were experimentally synthesized and characterized, triggering not only enormous excitement in the community but also some debates. In this Article, we review the computational-driven discoveries and the recent developments in the field from various essential aspects, including the theoretical, computational, and, specifically, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based approaches emerging within the paradigm of materials informatics. While challenges and critical gaps can be found in all of these approaches, AI/ML efforts specifically remain in its infant stage for good reasons. However, opportunities exist when these approaches can be further developed and integrated in concerted efforts, in which AI/ML approaches could play more important roles.",

We investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction. Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum, reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a topological phase.",

    "summary": "The disorder operator, as an easily measured non-local observable, displays great potential in detecting intrinsic information of field theories. It has been systematically studied in 1d and 2d quantum systems, while the knowledge of 3d is still limited. The disorder operator associated with U(1) global symmetry exhibits rich geometric dependence on the shape of the spatial region at a quantum critical point, meanwhile, (3+1)D is the upper critical dimension for O(N) criticalities, both of which pose a challenge for exploring the disorder operator in high dimensions. In this work, we investigate the scaling behaviors of disorder operators in (3+1)D O(3) models through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation combined with theoretical analysis. The universal contributions, such as the current central charge, have been revealed in our calculation, which establishes a concrete link between lattice simulations and continuum field theory. This work opens new avenues for experimental and numerical exploration of universal properties at quantum critical points in (3+1)D models.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3 tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

Antimony (Sb), a monoatomic PCM with ultrafast switching capabilities, stands out as the only elemental member of this group for which the properties of the liquid and supercooled states have so far remained unknown. In this work, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with a neural network potential trained on first-principles data to investigate the liquid, supercooled, and amorphous phases of Sb across a broad pressure-temperature range. We uncover clear signatures of anomalous behavior, including a density maximum and non-monotonic thermodynamic response functions, and introduce a novel octahedral order parameter that captures the structural evolution of the liquid. Moreover, extrapolation of the viscosity to the glass transition, based on configurational and excess entropies, indicates that Sb is a highly fragile material. Our results present a compelling new case for the connection between the liquid-state properties of phase-change materials and their unique ability to combine high amorphous-phase stability with ultrafast crystallization.",

    "summary": "We propose digitized counterdiabatic quantum sampling (DCQS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient sampling from energy-based models, such as low-temperature Boltzmann distributions. The method utilizes counterdiabatic protocols, which suppress non-adiabatic transitions, with an iterative bias-field procedure that progressively steers the sampling toward low-energy regions. We observe that the samples obtained at each iteration correspond to approximate Boltzmann distributions at effective temperatures. By aggregating these samples and applying classical reweighting, the method reconstructs the Boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature. We define a scalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the total variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann distribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random couplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through transfer-matrix methods. We then apply it to a higher-order spin-glass Hamiltonian with 156 qubits executed on IBM quantum processors. We show that classical sampling algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and the state-of-the-art low-temperature technique parallel tempering, require up to three orders of magnitude more samples to match the quality of DCQS, corresponding to an approximately 2x runtime advantage. Boltzmann sampling underlies applications ranging from statistical physics to machine learning, yet classical algorithms exhibit exponentially slow convergence at low temperatures. Our results thus demonstrate a robust route toward scalable and efficient Boltzmann sampling on current quantum processors.",

Using first-principles calculations, we show that compressive strain along [001] direction stabilizes an altermagnetic phase in RuO$_2$ thin films grown on (100) and (110) TiO$_2$ substrates. We further identify that compressive strain enhances the density of states near the Fermi level, resulting in a Fermi surface instability and the emergence of altermagnetism. The magnitude of strain and the associated increase in the density of states can be tuned by varying the film thickness, as systematically confirmed by x-ray diffraction and photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Symmetry analysis further reveals that (100) RuO$_2$ hosts an ideal altermagnetic order, whereas broken symmetry in (110) films leads to an uncompensated ferrimagnetic state. Finally, we discuss the effects of Hubbard $U$ parameters and evaluate the realistic tunneling magnetoresistance of (100) RuO$_2$.",

A direct consequence of this discrete symmetry breaking is the charge or Mott gap itself. From extensive numerics, we proffer that it is the charge compressibility that acts as the underlying order parameter as it is zero in the insulator and non-zero in the metallic state. Additionally, the Widom line (temperature of the extremum of the compressibility) obeys a universal scaling of $T_m=0.39U$ deep into the insulating state directly from $Z_2$ universality. Furthermore, the temperature at which the second derivative of the compressibility has a minimum is independent of lattice geometry, exhibiting a universal scaling of $|U-U_c|^\\alpha$ where $\\alpha\\approx 1$. Finally, our computational approach reproduces the key features of the doping dependence of the compressibility demonstrated in recent cold-atom quantum simulators of the Hubbard model, thereby corroborating our conclusions on $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ universality.",

In this work, we report the formation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either of these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki chain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact ferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy in its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization group simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping this model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic calculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced kinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic magnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak mixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in topological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum geometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers.",

    "summary": "Phase fluctuations are a key factor distinguishing nonthermal (ultrafast) and thermal phase transitions. Charge order in cuprates is characterized by short-range coherence while competing with superconductivity, and as such, it provides a representative case to study the role of phase fluctuation in coupled order parameter dynamics. In this work, we investigated the intertwined evolution of charge order and superconductivity in cuprate/manganite heterostructures using time-resolved resonant X-ray scattering. The resulting dynamics are analyzed within a space- and time-dependent nonperturbative model capturing both amplitude and phase dynamics. At low fluence, photo-induced suppression of superconductivity results in a nonthermal enhancement of charge order, underscoring the dynamic competition between charge order and superconductivity. With increasing fluence, the slowing down of melting and recovery dynamics is observed, indicating a critical role of phase fluctuations. At high fluence, both charge order and superconductivity remain suppressed for an extended time window due to decoupling between amplitude and phase dynamics and the delayed recovery of phase coherence. Our work underscores the importance of phase fluctuation for understanding the dynamic competition between order parameters in cuprates.",

    "summary": "We study quantum quench dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional critical systems, starting from thermal pure states called crosscap states, and evolving them under spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians. The spatial inhomogeneity is introduced through a deformation of the Hamiltonian, expressed as linear combinations of the generators of the $SL^{(q)}(2,\\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. We analyze the free massless Dirac fermion theory and holographic conformal field theory as prototypical examples of integrable and non-integrable dynamics. Consistent with general expectations, \"M\\\"obius-type\" deformations lead to thermalization in the non-integrable case, and to periodic revivals in the integrable one. In contrast, \"sine-square-type\" and \"displacement-type\" deformations prevent both thermalization and scrambling, instead producing late-time, graph-like entanglement patterns. These patterns emerge from the interplay between the deformed Hamiltonian and the crosscap initial state and appear to be universal: they are determined solely by the deformation profile while remaining largely insensitive to microscopic details. Finally, we perform a holographic calculation in three-dimensional gravity using AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, which reproduces the main features of our (1+1)-dimensional study.",

    "summary": "Heat conduction and radiation are two of the three fundamental modes of heat transfer, playing a critical role in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications ranging from energy systems to materials science. However, traditional physics-based simulation methods for modeling these processes often suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In recent years, the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have demonstrated remarkable potential in the modeling of nanoscale heat conduction and radiation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent AI-driven developments in modeling heat conduction and radiation at the nanoscale. We first discuss the ML techniques for predicting phonon properties, including phonon dispersion and scattering rates, which are foundational for determining material thermal properties. Next, we explore the role of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics simulations and their applications to bulk materials, low-dimensional systems, and interfacial transport. We then review the ML approaches for solving radiative heat transfer problems, focusing on data-driven solutions to Maxwell's equations and the radiative transfer equation. We further discuss the ML-accelerated inverse design of radiative energy devices, including optimization-based and generative model-based methods. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions, including data availability, model generalization, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Through this survey, we aim to provide a foundational understanding of how AI techniques are reshaping thermal science and guiding future research in nanoscale heat transfer.",

    "summary": "We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of charge density waves in a pumped one-dimensional Hubbard superlattice with staggered onsite Coulomb interactions at half-filling, using time-dependent exact diagonalization. In equilibrium, the system exhibits commensurate charge correlations consistent with the superlattice periodicity. Under laser excitation, the charge correlation function exhibits distinct behaviors across four representative frequencies, spanning both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. Notably, we observe a laser-induced commensurate-to-incommensurate transition in the charge order, manifested by a shift in the peak wavevector of the charge structure factor. This transition is driven by sublattice-selective doublon-holon dynamics, where the laser frequency and intensity determine whether excitations predominantly destabilize the charge order on the weakly or strongly interacting sublattice. Our analysis of the excitation spectrum and site-resolved correlation dynamics reveals the underlying mechanisms of this transition. These results suggest a promising optical strategy for controlling charge order in superlattice-based quantum materials.",

To address this, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to investigate the structural and defect-related physical properties in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N. The MLIP is first validated by reproducing the equation of state, lattice constants, and elastic constants of the binary endpoints, GaN and AlN, as well as known defect formation and migration energies from density functional theory and empirical potentials. We then apply the MLIP to evaluate elastic constants of AlGaN alloys, which reveals a non-linear relation with alloying effect. Our results reveal that nitrogen Frenkel pair formation energies and the migration barriers for nitrogen point defects are highly sensitive to the local chemical environment and migration path. In contrast, Ga and Al vacancy migration energies remain relatively insensitive to alloy composition, whereas their interstitial migration energies exhibit stronger compositional dependence. These results provide quantitative insight into how alloying influences defect energetics in AlGaN, informing defect engineering strategies for improved material performance.",

While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures. Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures, proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.",

    "summary": "Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges. Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models. Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed STM systems.",

From approximate analytical insights based on a simple model that captures the essential physics of the doublon excitations, we show that entanglement in the initial state leads to collective enhancement of the propagation velocity $v_{\\text{SU}(N)}$ when $N>2$, becoming equal to the velocity of the Bose-Hubbard model in the large-$N$ limit. These results are supported by numerical calculations of the density-density correlation in the quench dynamics for $N=2,3,4,$ and $6$.",

Solving self-consistently a mean-field Hubbard model, accounting also for the energy cost of distorting the lattice to produce an electric polarization, our results show that metallic altermagnetism and ferroelectricity suppress or enhance each other depending on the doping level of the system. Close to half-filling, the system can lower its energy by becoming altermagnetic, but at the expense of losing the electric polarization. Away from half-filling, the coexistence of ferroelectricity and altermagnetism is much more robust toward an increase in the energy cost associated with the deformation of the lattice. Therefore, our results suggest that filling fractions corresponding to doping relatively far away from half-filling constitute the most promising regime to look for coexistent ferroelectricity and metallic altermagnetism with mutual enhancement. Moreover, we propose a way to electrically tune altermagnetism between nodal and nodeless phases as well as achieving coexistence of a nodal and nodeless phase for the two spin species.",

Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.",

We first employ a phenomenological field theory to qualitatively determine the phase diagram. Furthermore, we generalize a previously established alternating pattern of superconductor and tunneling regions, coupled to fractional quantum Hall edge states, to map the problem onto a topological Josephson junction chain involving lattice parafermions. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we establish a phase diagram composed of Mott insulating phases and two different Luttinger liquids whose fundamental excitations carry charges 2e and $2e/3$, respectively. In agreement with analytical considerations using conformal field theory, we numerically find transitions of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type as well as a continuous $\\mathbb Z_3 \\times U(1)$ second-order phase transition characterized by central charge c = 9/5. We finally extract information about a possible ground state degeneracy and comment on the stability of parafermionic edge states in the presence of fluctuations. These theoretical foundations can be expected to be of practical importance for gate-defined FCI-SC heterostructures in moir\\'e materials, in which broad superconducting transitions indicative of strong order parameter fluctuations were observed.",

Currently, machine learning methods are developing rapidly in polymer material research; although they have significantly accelerated material prediction and design, their complexity has also caused difficulties in understanding and application for researchers in traditional fields. In response to the above issues, this paper first analyzes the inherent challenges in the research and development of polymer materials, including structural complexity and the limitations of traditional trial-and-error methods. To address these problems, it focuses on introducing key basic technologies such as molecular descriptors and feature representation, data standardization and cleaning, and records a number of high-quality polymer databases. Subsequently, it elaborates on the key role of machine learning in polymer property prediction and material design, covering the specific applications of algorithms such as traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning; further, it deeply expounds on data-driven design strategies, such as reverse design, high-throughput virtual screening, and multi-objective optimization. The paper also systematically introduces the complete process of constructing high-reliability machine learning models and summarizes effective experimental verification, model evaluation, and optimization methods. Finally, it summarizes the current technical challenges in research, such as data quality and model generalization ability, and looks forward to future development trends including multi-scale modeling, physics-informed machine learning, standardized data sharing, and interpretable machine learning.",

    "summary": "We design and demonstrate heuristic quantum advantage with peaked circuits (HQAP circuits) on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum processor. Through extensive experimentation with state-of-the-art classical simulation strategies, we identify a clear gap between classical and quantum runtimes. Our largest instance involves all-to-all connectivity with 2000 two-qubit gates, which H2 can produce the target peaked bitstring directly in under 2 hours. Our extrapolations from leading classical simulation techniques such as tensor networks with belief propagation and Pauli path simulators indicate the same instance would take years on exascale systems (Frontier, Summit), suggesting a potentially exponential separation. This work marks an important milestone toward verifiable quantum advantage, as well as providing a useful benchmarking protocol for current utility-scale quantum hardware. We sketch our protocol for designing these circuits and provide extensive numerical results leading to our extrapolation estimates. Separate from our constructed HQAP circuits, we prove hardness on a decision problem involving generic peaked circuits. When both the input and output bitstrings of a peaked circuit are unknown, determining whether the circuit is peaked constitutes a QCMA-complete problem, meaning the problem remains hard even for a quantum polynomial-time machine under commonly accepted complexity assumptions. Inspired by this observation, we propose an application of the peaked circuits as a potentially quantum-safe encryption scheme~\\cite{chen2016report,kumar2020post,joseph2022transitioning,dam2023survey}. We make our peaked circuits publicly available and invite the community to try additional methods to solve these circuits to see if this gap persists even with novel classical techniques.",

    "summary": "We have theoretically investigated the magnetic properties of the quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor $\\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ using a multi-band Hubbard model and the two-particle self-consistent method. We have employed a four-band model, where each BETS molecule is considered as a site, and a two-band model, treating each BETS dimer as a site. Our results for the temperature dependence of the Stoner factor reveal a kink around $T_\\mathrm{kink} \\approx 5 \\mathrm{meV}$, indicating a change in the dominant magnetic fluctuations. Above $T_\\mathrm{kink}$, it shows a broad structure indicating smeared antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations, while below $T_\\mathrm{kink}$, the spin susceptibility peaks at a wavevector corresponding to spin-density-wave (SDW)-like fluctuations. As the intra-dimer transfer integral increases, the kink disappears, and the AFM fluctuations are enhanced. Our findings are consistent with experimental observations, which also report a change in magnetic properties from AFM to SDW-like fluctuations upon cooling.",

    "summary": "With the increasing miniaturization of electronic components and the need to optimize thermal management, it has become essential to understand heat transport at metal/semiconductor interfaces. While it has been recognized decades ago that an electron phonon channel may take place at metal-semiconductor interfaces, its existence is still controversial. Here, we investigate thermal transport at metal-silicon interfaces using the combination of first principles calculations and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF). We explain how to correct NEGF formalism to account for the out of equilibrium nature of the energy carriers in the vicinity of the interface. The relative corrections to the equilibrium distribution are shown to arise from the spectral mean free paths of silicon and may reach 15 percents. Applying these corrections, we compare the predictions of NEGF to available experimental data for Au/Si, Pt/Si and Al/Si interfaces. Based on this comparison, we infer the value of the electron phonon interfacial thermal conductance by employing the two temperature model. We find that interfacial thermal transport at Au/Si interfaces is mainly driven by phonon phonon processes, and that electron phonon processes play a negligible role in this case. By contrast, for Al/Si interfaces, we show that phonon-phonon scattering alone can not explain the experimental values reported so far, and we estimate that the electron-phonon interfacial conductance accounts for one third of the total conductance. This work demonstrates the importance of the electron-phonon conductance at metal-silicon interfaces and calls for systematic experimental investigation of thermal transport at these interfaces at low temperatures. It paves the way for an accurate model to predict the conductance associated to the interfacial electron phonon channel.",

    "summary": "Accurately describing the ground state of strongly correlated systems is essential for understanding their emergent properties. Neural Network Backflow (NNBF) is a powerful variational ansatz that enhances mean-field wave functions by introducing configuration-dependent modifications to single-particle orbitals. Although NNBF is theoretically universal in the limit of large networks, we find that practical gains saturate with increasing network size. Instead, significant improvements can be achieved by using a multi-determinant ansatz. We explore efficient ways to generate these multi-determinant expansions without increasing the number of variational parameters. In particular, we study single-step Lanczos and symmetry projection techniques, benchmarking their performance against diffusion Monte Carlo and NNBF applied to alternative mean fields. Benchmarking on a doped periodic square Hubbard model near optimal doping, we find that a Lanczos step, diffusion Monte Carlo, and projection onto a symmetry sector all give similar improvements achieving state-of-the-art energies at minimal cost. By further optimizing the projected symmetrized states directly, we gain significantly in energy. Using this technique we report the lowest variational energies for this Hamiltonian on $4\\times 16$ and $4 \\times 8$ lattices as well as accurate variance extrapolated energies. We also show the evolution of spin, charge, and pair correlation functions as the quality of the variational ansatz improves.",

Here, we propose novel AI workflows for analyzing snapshot datasets from tensor-network simulations of the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model over a broad range of temperature and doping. The 2D Hubbard model is an archetypal strongly correlated system, hosting diverse intriguing phenomena including Mott insulators, anomalous metals, and high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Our AI techniques yield fresh perspectives on the intricate quantum correlations underpinning these phenomena and facilitate universal omnimetry for ultracold-atom simulations of the corresponding strongly correlated systems.",

However, these methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.",

Here, we assess the predictive capabilities of the foundational machine learning model MACE-MP-0 - trained on a broad chemical space and applied without system-specific fine-tuning - for the temperature-dependent behavior of CsSnBr3 and Cs2SnBr6. Molecular Dynamics simulations in the NpT ensemble were performed from 100 K to 500 K, and thermodynamic and structural descriptors including enthalpy, specific heat, radial distribution functions, translational order, bond angle distributions, and vibrational spectra were analyzed. Our results show that CsSnBr3 undergoes a low-temperature orthorhombic-to-cubic phase transition, evidenced by both the evolution of lattice parameters and subtle anomalies in enthalpy and specific heat, although the experimentally observed intermediate tetragonal phase is not captured. In contrast, Cs2SnBr6 remains cubic and maintains a more rigid octahedral framework across the entire temperature range. Overall, MACE-MP-0 qualitatively reproduces key thermal and structural features of these materials, highlighting its usefulness as a first step for studying new materials. For cases where capturing more subtle phase behavior is required, system-specific fine-tuning with Density Functional Theory data should be considered.",

    "summary": "Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.",

Here, we introduce MaterialsGalaxy, a comprehensive platform that deeply fuses experimental and theoretical data in condensed matter physics. Its core innovation is a structure similarity-driven data fusion mechanism that quantitatively links cross-modal records - spanning diffraction, crystal growth, computations, and literature - based on their underlying atomic structures. The platform integrates artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction, generative models for crystal structure prediction, and machine learning property predictors, to enhance data interpretation and accelerate materials discovery. We demonstrate that MaterialsGalaxy effectively integrates these disparate data sources, uncovering hidden correlations and guiding the design of novel materials. By bridging the long-standing gap between experiment and theory, MaterialsGalaxy provides a new paradigm for data-driven materials research and accelerates the discovery of advanced materials.",

    "summary": "Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that investigates the capabilities of quantum computers for learning tasks. While QML models can theoretically offer advantages such as exponential speed-ups, challenges in data loading and the ability to scale to relevant problem sizes have prevented demonstrations of such advantages on practical problems. In particular, the encoding of arbitrary classical data into quantum states usually comes at a high computational cost, either in terms of qubits or gate count. However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks. We further analyze the performance of various quantum classifiers, such as quantum kernel methods, parameterized quantum circuits, and tensor-network classifiers, and we compare them to convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focus on the performance of the quantum classifiers as we introduce nonlinear functions of the input state, e.g., by letting the circuit parameters depend on the input state.",

    "summary": "The remarkable discovery of high temperature superconductivity in bulk bilayer nickelates under high pressure has prompted the conjecture that epitaxial compressive strain might mimic essential aspects of hydrostatic pressure. The successful realization of superconductivity in films on SrLaAlO4 (001) (SLAO) supports this correspondence, yet it remains unclear whether the rich pressure-temperature phase diagram of bilayer nickelates can be systematically mapped (and studied at ambient pressure) as a function of epitaxial strain. To this end, experimental access near the elusive edge of the superconducting phase boundary would provide invaluable insight into the nature of the superconducting state and the ground state from which it emerges. It would also offer a benchmark for theoretical models. Here we report superconducting bilayer nickelates grown on LaAlO3 (001) (LAO), where the compressive strain required for ambient-pressure superconductivity is nearly halved to -1.2%. These films exhibit a superconducting onset above 10 K and reach zero resistance at 3 K, with normal-state transport properties differing from those of films grown on SLAO. Our results offer a new opportunity to probe emergent phenomena near the superconducting phase boundary in the strain-temperature phase diagram of bilayer nickelates.",

However, these methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.",

    "summary": "The study of real-time dynamics of fermions remains one of the last frontiers beyond the reach of classical simulations and is key to our understanding of quantum behavior in chemistry and materials, with implications for quantum technology. Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a fixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits variational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via systematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network methods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high accuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques and experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a practical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics.",

    "summary": "Low-dimensional quantum systems host a variety of exotic states, such as symmetry-protected topological ground states in spin-1 Haldane chains. Real-world realizations of such states could serve as practical quantum simulators for quantum phases if the interactions can be controlled. However, many proposed models, such as the AKLT state, require unconventional forms of spin interactions beyond standard Heisenberg terms, which do not naturally emerge from microscopic (Coulomb) interactions. Here, we demonstrate a general strategy to induce a biquadratic term between two spin-1 sites and to tune its strength $\\beta$ by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers in between them. $\\beta$ is controlled by the ratio between Heisenberg couplings to and in between the spacer spins. Increasing this ratio first increases the magnitude of $\\beta$ and decreases the correlation length of edge states, but at a critical value of the ratio, we observe a quantum phase transition between two spin-liquid phases with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Detailed atomistic calculations reveal that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, respectively, which could be realized by state-of-the-art bottom-up growth technology, yield precisely the couplings required to approach the AKLT state. These findings deliver a blueprint for engineering unconventional interactions in bottom-up synthesized quantum simulators.",

To benefit from such machinery, we need powerful tools for approximating measures. We develop a deep neural network approximation of Young measures in this paper. The key idea is to write the Young measure as push-forward of Gaussian measures, and reformulate the problem of finding Young measures to finding the corresponding push-forward. We approximate the push-forward map using deep neural networks by encoding the reformulated variational problem in the loss function. After developing the framework, we demonstrate the approach in several numerical examples. We hope this framework and our illustrative computational experiments provide a pathway for approximating Young measures in their wide range of applications from modeling complex microstructure in materials to non-cooperative games.",

Here we demonstrate an unconventional relativistic spin polarization in an altermagnet by spin and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy of electronic bands in single-domain MnTe. The relativistic spin-orbit coupling origin is revealed by observing that the alternating momentum-dependent spin polarization is orthogonal to the magnetic-ordering vector. The collinearity, even-parity and time-reversal-odd nature of the demonstrated relativistic spin polarization in the altermagnet is unparalleled in conventional forms of the relativistic spin polarization. Our experimental results and methodology are supported by non-relativistic spin-symmetry and relativistic magnetic-symmetry analyses, and microscopic ab initio ground-state and photoemission theory.",

    "summary": "Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, there are conflicting conclusions in the literature regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study the core-level and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ resonant photoemission spectroscopy(resonant-PES) to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) in the Ni $3d$ states is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge transfer cluster model calculations using the experimentally estimated $U_{dd}$ (= 3.7 eV), and the results show that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative charge-transfer energy ($\\Delta$ = -2.8 eV). The same type of cluster model analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator character, with $U_{dd}$ = 7.0 eV and $\\Delta$ = 6.0 eV. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$<$NiO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO is not due to an increase in $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron is attributed to negative-$\\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$. However, since $U_{dd}$$>$$|\\Delta|$, the results indicate the important role of a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ in making NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac semi-metal.",

    "summary": "Quantum heuristics offer a potential advantage for combinatorial optimization but are constrained by near-term hardware limitations. We introduce Iterative-QAOA, a variant of QAOA designed to mitigate these constraints. The algorithm combines a non-variational, shallow-depth circuit approach using fixed-parameter schedules with an iterative warm-starting process. We benchmark the algorithm on Just-in-Time Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JIT-JSSP) instances on IonQ Forte Generation QPUs, representing some of the largest such problems ever executed on quantum hardware. We compare the performance of the algorithm against both the Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQITE) algorithm and the non-variational Linear Ramp (LR) QAOA algorithm. We find that Iterative-QAOA robustly converges to find optimal solutions as well as high-quality, near-optimal solutions for all problem instances evaluated. We evaluate the algorithm on larger problem instances up to 97 qubits using tensor network simulations. The scaling behavior of the algorithm indicates potential for solving industrial-scale problems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.",

In contrast, K$_2$AgF$_4$ adopts a collinear intralayer antiferromagnetic configuration coupled with ferromagnetic orbital ordering. The A-AFM KAgF$_3$ presents distinct altermagnetic responses, including: (i) prominent anomalous transport effects, such as anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC), and thermal anomalous Hall conductivity (TAHC); and (ii) strong magneto-optical responses, manifested through pronounced Kerr and Faraday effects. On the other hand, K$_2$AgF$_4$ behaves as a conventional collinear antiferromagnet preserving $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, hence precluding the emergence of an anomalous Hall response.",

This unconventional magnetic order gives rise to a range of phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect, chiral magnons, and nonlinear photocurrents. Here, using spin space group (SSG) symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate an efficient strategy to control altermagnetism in two-dimensional multiferroics through ferroelectric polarization and interlayer sliding. For material realization, we find that monolayer and bilayer FeCuP2S6 exhibit finite spin splitting when ferroelectric sublattices are connected by nonsymmorphic screw-axis operations rather than pure translation or inversion symmetry. Interlayer sliding further enables reversible switching or suppression of spin splitting through modifications of the SSG. Our calculations further reveal that the anomalous Hall response serves as a direct probe of these spin-split states. These findings establish two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics as promising platforms for realizing electrically controllable altermagnetism and advancing next-generation spintronic and magnetoelectric technologies.",

    "summary": "A novel magnetic class blending ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, termed altermagnetism, has gained significant attention for its staggered order in coordinate and momentum spaces, time-reversal symmetry-breaking phenomena, and promising applications in spintronics. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_{2}$) has been considered a candidate material for altermagnetism, yet the presence of magnetic moments on Ru atoms remains a subject of debate. In this study, we systematically investigated the magnetic properties of RuO$_{2}$ powder using nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements. The NQR spectra show that there is no internal magnetic field. Furthermore, the temperature independence of spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1/T_1T$, proves that there are no magnetic fluctuations. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that Ru atoms in RuO$_{2}$ possess neither static magnetic moments nor fluctuating magnetic moments, and thus RuO$_{2}$ does not possess the magnetic characteristics essential for altermagnetism.",

Working in the gaugeless Hamiltonian formulation -- where the gauge field is exactly integrated out and no truncation of the electric flux is required -- we investigate scattering processes across sectors of fixed global baryon number $B = 0, 1, 2$. These correspond respectively to meson-meson, meson-baryon, and baryon-baryon collisions. At strong coupling, the $B = 0$ and $B = 2$ channels exhibit predominantly elastic dynamics closely resembling those of the U(1) Schwinger model. In contrast, the mixed $B = 1$ sector shows qualitatively new behavior: meson and baryon wave packets become entangled during the collision, and depending on their initial kinematics, the slower state becomes spatially delocalized while the faster one propagates ballistically. We characterize these processes through local observables, entanglement entropy, and the information-lattice, which together reveal how correlations build up and relax during the interaction. Our results establish a first benchmark for non-Abelian real-time scattering from first principles and open the path toward quantum-simulation studies of baryon-number dynamics and inelastic processes in gauge theories.",

    "summary": "The discovery of effective molecular modulators is essential for advancing perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the research process is hindered by the vastness of chemical space and the time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error experimental screening. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) offers significant potential for accelerating materials discovery. However, applying ML to PSCs remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and limitations of traditional quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Here, we apply a chemical informed transfer learning framework based on pre-trained deep neural networks, which achieves high accuracy in predicting the molecular modulator's effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. This framework is established through systematical benchmarking of diverse molecular representations, enabling lowcost and high-throughput virtual screening over 79,043 commercially available molecules. Furthermore, we leverage interpretability techniques to visualize the learned chemical representation and experimentally characterize the resulting modulator-perovskite interactions. The top molecular modulators identified by the framework are subsequently validated experimentally, delivering a remarkably improved champion PCE of 26.91% in PSCs.",

    "summary": "A representation of Lattice Gauge Theories (LGT) suitable for simulations with tensor network state methods or with quantum computers requires a truncation of the Hilbert space to a finite dimensional approximation. In particular for U(1) LGTs, several such truncation schemes are known, which we compare with each other using tensor network states. We show that a functional basis obtained from single plaquette Hamiltonians -- which we call plaquette state basis -- outperforms the other schemes in two spatial dimensions for plaquette, ground state energy and mass gap, as it is delivering accurate results for a wide range of coupling strengths with a minimal number of basis states. We also show that this functional basis can be efficiently used in three spatial dimensions. Green's function Monte Carlo appears to be a highly useful tool to verify tensor network states results, which deserves further investigation in the future.",

    "summary": "Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.",

    "summary": "By combining density functional theory (DFT) and density matrix renormalization group calculations, we investigate the unusual pressure dependence of superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in the nickelate superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Using the hopping integrals and on-site potentials obtained by fitting the DFT band structures, we map a quantum phase diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model with increasing pressure in a ladder geometry, which has an intermediate Hubbard repulsion and a Hund's coupling. Near $3/8$ filling, we find a strong spin density wave order, which at $3/8$ filling shows a real-space spin pattern similar to the spin-charge stripe order along a lattice direction. At $21/64$ filling, we find a superconducting phase with interlayer superconductivity (SC) in both the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as in-plane SC in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Intriguingly, the SC is weakened with increasing pressure and transits to a Luttinger liquid above $80$ GPa, which qualitatively agrees with the experimental observations of decreasing $T_c$ with increasing pressure and a transition to Fermi liquid above $80$ GPa in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a comparative study, we further show that the ratio of interaction to hopping integral, which reduces moderately with increasing pressure, may play a dominant role in the weakening of SC. Our results of this experimentally relevant model not only find a robust SC through suppressing the competing spin density wave order, but also give new insight into the unusual pressure dependence of SC in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.",

However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum\\'s Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.",

Here, using attractive Hubbard model as a representative example, we demonstrate the emergence of such ''bosonic'' bound pairs in the presence of residual low-energy electrons through determinant quantum Monte Carlo computation of their propagators. Furthermore, above the superfluid temperature the electronic spectral function is found to display a typical non-Fermi liquid behavior, namely a pseudogap near the chemical potential. This study provides the microscopic foundation for scenarios of boson-fermion mixed liquid as effective descriptions for some of the strongly correlated functional materials.",

Recent train-classical, deploy-quantum approaches propose training classical surrogates of QCBMs and using quantum devices only for inference. We analyze the limitations of these methods arising from deployment discrepancies between classically trained and quantumly deployed parameters. Using the Fourier decomposition of the Born rule in terms of correlators, we quantify this discrepancy analytically. Approximating the decomposition via distribution truncation and classical surrogation provides concrete examples of such discrepancies, which we demonstrate numerically. We study this effect using tensor-networks and Pauli-propagation-based classical surrogates. Our study examines the use of IQP circuits, matchcircuits, Heisenberg-chain circuits, and Haldane-chain circuits for the QCBM ansatz. In doing so, we derive closed-form expressions for Pauli propagation in IQP circuits and the dynamical Lie algebra of the Haldane chain, which may be of independent interest.",

    "summary": "Materials which show a strong time-reversal symmetry-breaking response leading to spin-polarization phenomena, in conjunction with antiparallel magnetic alignments producing zero net magnetization, have recently been identified, classified, and been given the name 'altermagnets'. However, measuring and diagnosing possible candidates as altermagnetics still remains a challenge. From the uncertainty of the material being an altermagnet, additional experimental probes are essential to resolve this. Here, we propose using spin-dependent and magnetic momentum density probes such as spin-polarised positron annihilation and revisiting magnetic Compton scattering. By looking at the previously claimed altermagnetic candidates RuO2, CrSb and MnTe, we present theoretical altermagnetic calculations of the experimental quantities measured by these probes. We show that these quantities should produce a measurable signal and unequivocally confirm the altermagnetic state. We also highlight the additional benefits from these probes such as extracting spin-resolved Fermi surfaces which are key for further understanding the nature of the altermagnetic state.",

We consider two classes of one-dimensional lattice systems: (i) a non-interacting lattice with nearest-neighbor and beyond, i.e., long-ranged (power-law) hopping, and (ii) a lattice that is interacting via short-range interactions modeled by a fermionic quartic Hamiltonian. We study the evolution of the local density profile $n_i(t)$ within the system and the growth of the total particle number $N(t)$ in it. For case (i), we provide analytical insights into the dynamics of the nearest-neighbor model using an adiabatic approximation, which relies on assuming faster relaxation of coherences of the single particle density matrix. For case (ii), we perform numerical computations using the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm and analyze the density profile and the growth exponent in $N(t)$. Our detailed study reveals an interesting interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and various environmentally induced mechanisms in open quantum systems, such as local source and bulk dephasing. It brings out rich dynamics, including universal dynamical scaling and anomalous behavior across various time scales and is of relevance to various quantum simulation platforms.",

    "summary": "Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys (RCCAs) can exhibit exceptional high-temperature strength, making such alloys promising candidates for high-temperature structural applications. However, current RCCAs do not possess the high-temperature oxidation resistance required to survive in oxidizing environments for more than a few hours at or above 1000$^\\circ$C, without relying primarily on an environmental barrier coating. Here, we present a machine-learning framework designed to predict the oxidation-induced specific mass changes of RCCAs exposed for 24 h at 1000$^\\circ$C in air, in order to support the search for oxidation-resistant alloys over a wide range of compositions. A database was constructed of experimental specific mass change data, upon oxidation at 900-1000$^\\circ$C for 24 h in air, for 77 compositions comprised of simple elements, binary alloys, and higher-order elemental systems. We then developed a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with physics-informed descriptors based on oxidation products, capturing the fundamental chemistry of oxide formation and stability. Application of this GPR model to the database yielded a MAE (mean absolute error) test score of 5.78 mg/cm$^2$, which was a significant improvement in accuracy relative to models only utilizing traditional alloy-based descriptors. Our model was used to screen over 5,100 quaternary RCCAs, revealing compositions with significantly lower predicted specific mass changes compared to existing literature sources. Overall, this work establishes a versatile and efficient strategy to accelerate the discovery of next-generation RCCAs with enhanced resistance to extreme environments.",

In this work, fourth-generation high-dimensional committee neural network potentials (4G-HDCNNPs) are developed for the first time, using active learning and query-by-committee, and introduced to the essential nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) as well as conformational entropy and anharmonicities from path integral (PI) molecular dynamics simulations. Using representative bulk water and air-water interface systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the developed framework in infrared and vibrational sum frequency generation spectral simulations. Specifically, by seamlessly integrating non-local charge transfer interactions from 4G-HDCNNPs with the NQEs from PI methods, our introduced methodology yields accurate infrared spectra using predicted charges from the 4G-HDCNNP architecture without explicit training of dipole moments. Our vibrational sum frequency generation spectra also illustrate high accuracy for the considered air-water interface system. The introduced framework in this work is general and offers a benchmark tool and a simple, practical paradigm for predictive spectral simulations of complex condensed phases and interfaces, free from empirical parameterizations and/or ad hoc fittings.",

Such methods are typically benchmarked against the numerical exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) in the Hubbard model; however, DQMC is limited by the fermionic sign problem and the uncertainties of numerical analytic continuation. To address these issues, we use the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model as a benchmarking platform to evaluate three many-body approximations: $GW$, $HGW$, and $SGW$. We compare the Green's functions, spectral functions, and response functions obtained from these approximations with the exact solutions. Our analysis shows that the $GW$ approximation, often considered insufficient for describing strong correlation, exhibits a previously unreported solution branch that accurately reproduces Mott physics in the HK model. In addition, using a covariant formalism, we find that $HGW$ provides an accurate description of charge response, while $SGW$ performs well for spin correlations. Overall, our work demonstrates that the HK model can effectively benchmark many-body approximations and helps refine the understanding of $GW$ methods in strongly correlated regimes.",

From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.",

Our results show that different DFAs yield similar electron densities, despite differences in their KS potentials, which originate primarily from the exchange and correlation contribution. We also find that the KS gap from the QMC density is typically larger than the KS gaps of most DFAs, with the exception of Hartree-Fock. Finally, the KS gap is sensitive to the inclusion of semicore states in the pseudopotentials, such that comparison with experiment should be done with caution.",

    "summary": "We propose a structure-property relation that could be key to the pseudogap phenomenology in cuprates. The underlying nonsymmorphic crystal structure in the low-temperature orthogonal phase endows the lattice with a sublattice structure that gives rise to two electronic bands near the Fermi surface. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the hybridization of these two bands generates small Fermi pockets and, correspondingly, a change in the number of free carriers. A sublattice structure also leads to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) matrix-element interference, naturally explaining the emergence of Fermi arcs and their consistency with closed Fermi pockets. We employ a symmetry analysis to highlight the expected Fermi surface properties, and complement it with density functional theory (DFT) for a quantitative discussion and comparison with recent experiments in doped La$_2$CuO$_4$. The proposed mechanism can consistently account for the most salient features of the pseudogap in the cuprates, namely, the Fermi surface reconstruction with the formation of small Fermi pockets and the corresponding change in carrier density, and the observation of Fermi arcs by ARPES.",

In this theory, spinons are described by a non-linear sigma model, while chargons are treated as fermions at a mean-field level. We investigate the instability to a superconducting state SC*, arising from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) where pairing between chargons occurs. Consistent with previous studies, our analysis reveals a coexisting phase characterized by both magnetic and superconducting order for the chargons. The central contribution of this work is the calculation of the feedback of superconductivity on spatial and temporal spin stiffnesses, thereby quantifying its impact on spin fluctuations. Our key finding is that superconductivity significantly suppresses these spin stiffnesses, enhancing quantum spin fluctuations. This enhancement suggests that superconductivity can play a crucial role in stabilizing quantum disorder against long-range magnetic ordering.",

The debate over whether genuine DQCP exists in physical SU(2) spin systems or the transition is weakly first-order has persisted for many years. In this letter, we construct a non-Hermitian easy-plane $J$-$Q$ model and perform sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation to explore the impact of non-Hermitian microscopic interactions on the transition that potentially features a DQCP. Our results demonstrate that the intensity of the first-order transitions significantly diminishes with the amplification of non-Hermitian interactions, serving as numerical evidence to support the notion that the transition in $J$-$Q$ model is quasi-critical, possibly in the vicinity of the fixed point governing DQCP in the complex plane, described by a non-unitary conformal field theory (CFT). The non-Hermitian interaction facilitates the approach towards such a complex fixed point in the parameter regime. Furthermore, our QMC study on the non-Hermitian J-Q model opens a new route to numerically investigating the nature of complex CFT in the microscopic model.",

    "summary": "Kernel matrices are ubiquitous in computational mathematics, often arising from applications in machine learning and scientific computing. In two or three spatial or feature dimensions, such problems can be approximated efficiently by a class of matrices known as hierarchical matrices. A hierarchical matrix consists of a hierarchy of small near-field blocks (or sub-matrices) stored in a dense format and large far-field blocks approximated by low-rank matrices. Standard methods for forming hierarchical matrices do not account for the fact that kernel matrices depend on specific hyperparameters; for example, in the context of Gaussian processes, hyperparameters must be optimized over a fixed parameter space. We introduce a new class of hierarchical matrices, namely, parametric (parameter-dependent) hierarchical matrices. Members of this new class are parametric $\\mathcal{H}$-matrices and parametric $\\mathcal{H}^{2}$-matrices. The construction of a parametric hierarchical matrix follows an offline-online paradigm. In the offline stage, the near-field and far-field blocks are approximated by using polynomial approximation and tensor compression. In the online stage, for a particular hyperparameter, the parametric hierarchical matrix is instantiated efficiently as a standard hierarchical matrix. The asymptotic costs for storage and computation in the offline stage are comparable to the corresponding standard approaches of forming a hierarchical matrix. However, the online stage of our approach requires no new kernel evaluations, and the far-field blocks can be computed more efficiently than standard approaches. {Numerical experiments show over $100\\times$ speedups compared with existing techniques.}",

Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.",

The SWAP networks, composed exclusively of local two-qubit gates, effectively mediate non-local qubit interactions. We investigate two distinct network architectures based on rectangular and triangular meshes of SWAP gates and analyze their performance in combination with spectral qubit ordering, which maps logical qubits to MPS sites based on the Laplacian of the logical qubit connectivity graph. The proposed framework is evaluated on synthetic MaxCut instances with varying graph connectivity, as well as on a dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on real historical asset data involving 180 qubits. On certain problem configurations, we observe an over 20$\\times$ reduction in error when combining spectral ordering and triangular SWAP networks compared to optimization with shuffled qubit ordering. Furthermore, an analysis of the entanglement entropy during portfolio optimization reveals that spectral qubit ordering not only improves solution quality but also enhances the total and spatially distributed entanglement within the MPS. These findings demonstrate that exploiting problem structure through spectral mapping and efficient routing networks can substantially enhance the performance of tensor-network-based optimization algorithms.",

    "summary": "Negative refraction of coherent phonons is crucial for thermal management and quantum information processing, but it remains unrealized because achieving the suitable dispersion for negative refraction simultaneously with long-range coherence is challenging. In this letter, we overcome this limitation by introducing a momentum compensation mechanism mediated by discrete translational symmetry. Interfacial reciprocal lattice vectors provide momentum compensation during phonon tunneling and induce asymmetric mode matching, resulting in negative refraction without requiring strong dispersion anisotropy or a negative-curvature band. Using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we demonstrate coherent negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures. This general mechanism enables active control of phonon flow via interfacial design, paving the way for applications in atomic-scale phonon lenses and directional thermal transport.",

    "summary": "The Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions computed from first principles is widely used to study electronic transport and nonequilibrium dynamics in materials. Calculating the e-ph collision integral is the most important step in the BTE, but it remains computationally costly, even with current MPI+OpenMP parallelization. This challenge makes it difficult to study materials with large unit cells and to achieve high resolution in momentum space. Here, we show acceleration of BTE calculations of electronic transport and ultrafast dynamics using graphical processing units (GPUs). We implement a novel data structure and algorithm, optimized for GPU hardware and developed using OpenACC, to process scattering channels and efficiently compute the collision integral. This approach significantly reduces the overhead for data referencing, movement, and synchronization. Relative to the efficient CPU implementation in the open-source package Perturbo (v2.2.0), used as a baseline, this approach achieves a speed-up of 40 times for both transport and nonequilibrium dynamics on GPU hardware, and achieves nearly linear scaling up to 100 GPUs. The novel data structure can be generalized to other electron interactions and scattering processes. We released this GPU implementation in the latest public version (v3.0.0) of Perturbo. The new MPI+OpenMP+GPU parallelization enables sweeping studies of e-ph physics and electron dynamics in conventional and quantum materials, and prepares Perturbo for exascale supercomputing platforms.",

    "summary": "Approximating a tensor in the tensor train (TT) format has many important applications in scientific computing. Rounding a TT tensor involves further compressing a tensor that is already in the TT format. This paper proposes new randomized algorithms for TT-rounding that uses sketches based on Khatri-Rao products (KRP). When the TT-ranks are known in advance, the proposed methods are comparable in cost to the sketches that used a sketching matrix in the TT-format~\\cite{al2023randomized}. However, the use of KRP sketches enables adaptive algorithms to round the tensor in the TT-format within a fixed user-specified tolerance. An important component of the adaptivity is the estimation of error using KRP sketching, for which we develop theoretical guarantees. We report numerical experiments on synthetic tensors, parametric low-rank kernel approximations, and the solution of parametric partial differential equations. The numerical experiments show that we obtain speed-ups of up to $50\\times$ compared to deterministic TT-rounding. Both the computational cost analysis and numerical experiments verify that the adaptive algorithms are competitive with the fixed rank algorithms, suggesting the adaptivity introduces only a low overhead.",

In contrast, structure-agnostic predictive algorithms allow exploring previously inaccessible domains of chemical space. Here we present a universal approach for enhancing composition-based materials property prediction by means of cross-modal knowledge transfer. Two formulations are proposed: implicit transfer involves pretraining chemical language models on multimodal embeddings, whereas explicit transfer suggests generating crystal structures and implementing structure-aware predictors. The proposed approaches were benchmarked on LLM4Mat-Bench and MatBench tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 25 out of 32 cases. In addition, we demonstrated how another modeling aspect of chemical language models - interpretability - benefits from applying a game-theoretic approach, which is able to incorporate high-order feature interactions.",

    "summary": "Quantum spin liquids are quantum phases of matter featuring collectively entangled states and emergent fractional many-body excitations. While methods exist to probe three-dimensional quantum spin liquids experimentally, these techniques lack the sensitivity to probe two-dimensional quantum spin liquids. This seriously hampers the study of potential monolayer quantum spin liquid candidates such as $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and 1T-TaSe$_2$. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) have recently been suggested as promising probes of the quantum spin liquid state, as they can access the spinon spectrum through inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). In this work, we employ this approach on the quantum spin liquid candidate material 1T-TaSe$_2$ and directly measure its low-energy inelastic excitations. We observe the emergence of a $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ reconstruction driven by the substrate, equivalent spectroscopy across all spin sites and coexistence of zero and finite energy excitations. We show that these observations are consistent with a modulated $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ spin liquid ground state. Our results demonstrate that IETS provides a powerful route to obtain atomic-scale insight into the magnetic excitations of two-dimensional materials, allowing to explore the effects of moir\\'e modulations on potential quantum liquid phases.",

    "summary": "Tensors with unit Frobenius norm are fundamental objects in many fields, including scientific computing and quantum physics, which are able to represent normalized eigenvectors and pure quantum states. While the tensor train decomposition provides a powerful low-rank format for tackling high-dimensional problems, it does not intrinsically enforce the unit-norm constraint. To address this, we introduce the normalized tensor train (NTT) decomposition, which aims to approximate a tensor by unit-norm tensors in tensor train format. The low-rank structure of NTT decomposition not only saves storage and computational cost but also preserves the underlying unit-norm structure. We prove that the set of fixed-rank NTT tensors forms a smooth manifold, and the corresponding Riemannian geometry is derived, paving the way for geometric methods. We propose NTT-based methods for low-rank tensor recovery, high-dimensional eigenvalue problem, estimation of stabilizer rank, and calculation of the minimum output R\\'enyi 2-entropy of quantum channels. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and scalability of the proposed NTT-based methods.",

The proof requires parametrising the Boltzmann weights using elliptic theta functions and showing they satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. We here give a simpler derivation of the integrability of the XYZ chain by explicitly constructing an extensive sequence of conserved charges from a matrix-product operator. We show that they commute with the XYZ Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions or an arbitrary boundary magnetic field. A straightforward generalisation yields impurity interactions that preserve the integrability. Placing such an impurity at the edge gives an integrable generalisation of the Kondo problem with a gapped bulk.

A particularly detrimental yet previously unexplored mechanism arises from QP multiplication facilitated by vortex trapping in superconducting quantum circuits, where a high-energy QP relaxes by breaking additional Cooper pairs and amplifying the QP population due to the locally reduced excitation gap and enhanced quantum confinement within the vortex core. Here we directly resolve this elusive QP multiplication process by revealing vortex-controlled QP self-generation in a highly nonequilibrium regime preceding the phonon bottleneck of QP relaxation. At sufficiently low fluence, femtosecond-resolved magneto-reflection spectroscopy directly reveals a continuously increasing QP population that is strongly dependent on magnetic-field-tuned vortex density and absent at higher excitation fluences. Quantitative analysis of the emergent QP pre-bottleneck dynamics further reveals that, although the phonon population saturates within $\\simeq$10~ps, both free and trapped QPs continue to grow in a self-sustained manner--hallmarks of the long-anticipated QP-vortex interactions in nonequilibrium superconductivity. We estimate a substantial increase of $\\sim$34\\% in QP density at vortex densities of $\\sim$ 100 magnetic flux quanta per $\\mathrm{\\mu m^{2}}$. Our findings establish a powerful spectroscopic tool for uncovering QP multiplication and reveal vortex-assisted QP relaxation as a critical materials bottleneck whose mitigation will be essential for resolving QP poisoning and enhancing coherence in superconducting qubits.",

    "summary": "Accurately determining ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems remains one of the major challenges of quantum simulation. In this work, we present a protocol for estimating the ground-state energy using only global time evolution under a target Hamiltonian. This avoids the need for controlled operations that are typically required in conventional quantum phase estimation and extends the algorithm applicability to analog simulators. Our method extracts energy differences from measurements of the Loschmidt echo over an initial ground-state approximation, combines them with direct energy measurements, and solves a set of equations to infer the individual eigenenergies. We benchmark this protocol on free-fermion systems, showing orders-of-magnitude precision gains over direct energy measurements on the initial state, with accuracy improving rapidly with initial-state fidelity and persisting for hundreds of modes. We further demonstrate applicability to the 2D Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models and show that the approach extends naturally to other observables such as order parameters. Finally, we analyze the effect of experimental imperfections and propose error-mitigation strategies. These results establish a practical route to compute physically relevant quantities with high precision using globally controlled quantum simulators.",

    "summary": "On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii) fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged. This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1. LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN adaptation practical for edge platforms.",

We close this gap with a unified effective field theory valid for frequencies lower than the material-dependent cutoff set by the band gap, plasma frequency, or similar scale. The action couples the electromagnetic gauge field to vector polarisation modes. An isotropic potential generates the optical susceptibilities, while a higher-dimension axion-like term captures magnetoelectric effects; quantisation on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour with doubled BRST ghosts preserves gauge symmetry in dissipative media. One-loop renormalisation-group equations reproduce the measured dispersion of the third-order susceptibility from terahertz to near-visible frequencies after matching a single datum per material. Real-time dynamics solved with a matrix-product-operator engine yield two to four percent agreement with published results for GaAs polariton cavities, epsilon-near-zero indium-tin-oxide films and superconducting quarton circuits. The current formulation is limited to these 1-D geometries and sub-cut-off frequencies; higher-dimensional or above-cut-off phenomena will require additional degrees of freedom or numerical methods.",

Traditional experimental measurement suffers from high cost and low efficiency, while theoretical simulation and graph neural network-based machine learning methods--especially crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs)--have become effective alternatives, achieving remarkable results in predicting material elastic properties. This study trained two CGCNN models using shear modulus and bulk modulus data of 10987 materials from the Matbench v0.1 dataset, which exhibit high accuracy (mean absolute error <13, coefficient of determination R-squared close to 1) and good generalization ability. Materials were screened to retain those with band gaps between 0.1-3.0 eV and exclude radioactive element-containing compounds. The final predicted dataset comprises two parts: 54359 crystal structures from the Materials Project database and 26305 crystal structures discovered by Merchant et al. (2023 Nature 624 80). Ultimately, this study completed the prediction of shear modulus and bulk modulus for 80664 inorganic crystals.

Recent advances in direct electron detectors have improved signal-to noise ratios via single-electron counting. However, accurately counting electrons at high fluence remains challenging. We developed a new method of electron counting for direct electron detectors, Back-Propagation Counting (BPC). BPC uses machine learning techniques designed for mathematical operations on large tensors but does not require large training datasets. In synthetic data, we show BPC is able to count multiple electron strikes per pixel and is robust to increasing occupancy. In experimental data, frames counted with BPC are shown to reconstruct diffraction peaks corresponding to individual nanoparticles with relatively higher intensity and produce images with improved contrast when compared to a standard counting method. Together, these results show that BPC excels in experiments where pixels see a high flux of electron irradiation such as in situ TEM movies and diffraction.",

We find that with increasing interaction, a many-body Lifshitz transition takes place when doubly occupied regions disappear from the Fermi surface and each momentum state becomes fully spin polarized. The spin susceptibility is directly evaluated from the Kubo formula in terms of many-body occupation probabilities. We find that the dynamical susceptibility, which possesses only transverse non-zero components for small wavevectors, develops a gap proportional to the interaction strength, and displays a sharp peak at a frequency increasing with the interaction. %with increasing frequency. Above the Lifshitz transition, this peak moves to the lower gap edge and becomes log-divergent. The signal intensity increases with the interaction up until the Lifshitz transition and saturates afterwards. The static susceptibility remains unaffected by the correlations and altermagnetism reduces the static transverse response.",

However, their effectiveness in providing scientifically accurate and comprehensive answers to complex questions within specialized domains remains an active area of research. Using the field of high-temperature cuprates as an exemplar, we evaluate the ability of LLM systems to understand the literature at the level of an expert. We construct an expert-curated database of 1,726 scientific papers that covers the history of the field, and a set of 67 expert-formulated questions that probe deep understanding of the literature. We then evaluate six different LLM-based systems for answering these questions, including both commercially available closed models and a custom retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system capable of retrieving images alongside text. Experts then evaluate the answers of these systems against a rubric that assesses balanced perspectives, factual comprehensiveness, succinctness, and evidentiary support. Among the six systems two using RAG on curated literature outperformed existing closed models across key metrics, particularly in providing comprehensive and well-supported answers. We discuss promising aspects of LLM performances as well as critical short-comings of all the models. The set of expert-formulated questions and the rubric will be valuable for assessing expert level performance of LLM based reasoning systems.",

Motivated by recent experimental evidence for a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal, we employ a theory of fermionic spinons which are confined with the onset of stripe order at low temperatures. The theory produces the `hourglass' spectrum near stripe-ordering wavevector observed by neutron scattering. Additional scattering from spinon continua and bound states appears at higher energies and elsewhere in the Brillouin zone, and could be observed by neutron or X-ray scattering.",

Our approach relies on experimentally extractable metrics of the phase-space evolution and physically-interpretable Fourier Neural Network surrogates of the time-dependent electric field. Using first-principles simulations, we demonstrate the stabilization of a symmetric phase in bismuth through impulsive Raman scattering under continuous and pulsed light sources in the presence of dissipation. Importantly, the method is gradient-free, which enables optimization loops based solely on experimental data, such as the measures of half-periods of oscillations in transient spectroscopy. Our framework thus provides a practical route for controlling non-equilibrium structural dynamics with light, opening pathways to stabilize hidden and metastable phases in quantum materials.",

By incorporating features such as space group symmetry, valence electron configurations, and composition-derived metrics, TXL Fusion classifies materials across trivial, TSM, and TI categories with improved accuracy and generalization compared to conventional approaches. The framework successfully identified new candidates, with representative cases further validated through density functional theory (DFT), confirming its predictive robustness. By uniting data-driven learning with chemical intuition, TXL Fusion enables rapid and interpretable exploration of complex materials spaces, establishing a scalable paradigm for the intelligent discovery of next-generation topological and quantum materials.",

In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a new class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional Hamiltonians. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.",

    "summary": "Understanding charge transfer at oxide interfaces is crucial for designing materials with emergent electronic and magnetic properties, especially in systems where strong electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling coexist. SrIrO$_3$/SrCoO$_3$ (SIO/SCO) superlattices offer a unique platform to explore these effects due to their contrasting electronic structures and magnetic behaviors. Building on past theory based on continuity of O 2p band alignment, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to model electron transfer from Ir to Co across the SIO/SCO interface. To characterize these effects, we synthesized epitaxial SIO/SCO superlattices via molecular beam epitaxy. Structural and transport measurements confirmed high crystallinity, metallic behavior, and suppression of Kondo scattering that has been reported in uniform SIO films. Further characterization via X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed orbital anisotropy and valence changes consistent with interfacial charge transfer. Co K- and L$_{2,3}$-edge and Ir L$_2$-edge spectra verified electron donation from Ir to Co, stabilizing the perovskite SCO phase and tuning the electronic structure of SIO via hole-doping. O K-edge XAS showed band alignment shifts in the SIO layer consistent with DFT predictions. Our work here provides a pathway for engineering oxide heterostructures with tailored magnetic and electronic properties.",

We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of the latter.",

    "summary": "Polymer packaging plays a crucial role in food preservation but poses major challenges in recycling and environmental persistence. To address the need for sustainable, high-performance alternatives, we employed a polymer informatics workflow to identify single- and multi-layer drop-in replacements for polymer-based packaging materials. Machine learning (ML) models, trained on carefully curated polymer datasets, predicted eight key properties across a library of approximately 7.4 million ring-opening polymerization (ROP) polymers generated by virtual forward synthesis (VFS). Candidates were prioritized by the enthalpy of polymerization, a critical metric for chemical recyclability. This screening yielded thousands of promising candidates, demonstrating the feasibility of replacing diverse packaging architectures. We then experimentally validated poly(p-dioxanone) (poly-PDO), an existing ROP polymer whose barrier performance had not been previously reported. Validation showed that poly-PDO exhibits strong water barrier performance, mechanical and thermal properties consistent with predictions, and excellent chemical recyclability (95% monomer recovery), thereby meeting the design targets and underscoring its potential for sustainable packaging. These findings highlight the power of informatics-driven approaches to accelerate the discovery of sustainable polymers by uncovering opportunities in both existing and novel chemistries.",

    "summary": "Many emergent phenomena appear in doped Mott insulators near the insulator-to-metal transition. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, superconductivity arises when antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is gradually suppressed by carrier doping, and a $\\textit{d}$-wave superconducting gap forms when an enigmatic nodal gap evolves into a point node. Here, we examine electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, the 5$\\textit{d}$-electron counterpart of cuprates, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At low doping levels, we observe the formation of electronic states near the Fermi level, accompanied by a gap at the AFM zone boundary, mimicking the AFM gap in electron-doped cuprates. With increasing doping, a distinct gap emerges along the (0,0)-($\\pi$,$\\pi$) nodal direction, paralleling that observed in hole-doped cuprates. This anomalous nodal gap persists after the collapse of the AFM gap and gradually decreases with further doping. It eventually vanishes into a point node of the reported $\\textit{d}$-wave gap. These observations replicate the characteristic features in both electron- and hole-doped cuprates, indicating a unified route toward nodal metallicity in doped spin-1/2 AFM Mott insulators.",

    "summary": "Quantum computing enables faster computations than clas-sical algorithms through superposition and entanglement. Circuit cutting and knitting are effective techniques for ame-liorating current noisy quantum processing unit (QPUs) er-rors via a divide-and-conquer approach that splits quantum circuits into subcircuits and recombines them using classical post-processing. The development of circuit partitioning and recomposing has focused on tailoring the simulation frame-work by replacing generic non-local gates with probabilistic local gates and measuring the classical communication com-plexity. Designing a protocol that supports algorithms and non-all-to-all qubit-connected physical hardware remains underdeveloped owing to the convoluted properties of cut-ting compact controlled unitary gates and hardware topology. In this study, we introduce shardQ, a method that leverages the SparseCut algorithm with matrix product state (MPS) compilation and a global knitting technique. This method elucidates the optimal trade-off between the computational time and error rate for quantum encoding with a theoretical proof, evidenced by an ablation analysis using an IBM Mar-rakesh superconducting-type QPU. This study also presents the results regarding application readiness.",

    "summary": "In this study, using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation, the water flow in carbon nanocones is studied using the TIP4P/2005 rigid water model. The results demonstrate a nonuniform dependence of the flow on the cone apex angle and the diameter of the opening where the flow is established, leading to a significant increase in the flow in some cases. The effects of cone diameter and pressure gradient are investigated to explain flow behavior with different system structures. We observed that some cones can optimize the water flow precisely. Nanocones with a larger opening facilitate the sliding of water, significantly increasing the flow, thus being promising membranes for technological use in water impurity separation processes. Nanocones with narrower opening angles limited water mobility due to excessive confinement. This phenomenon is linked to the ability of water to form a larger hydrogen-bond network in typical systems with diameters of this size, obtaining a single-layer water structure. Nanocones act as selective nanofilters capable of allowing water molecules to pass through while blocking salts and impurities. The conical shape of their structures creates a directed flow that improves separation efficiency. Membranes based on carbon nanocones are becoming promising for clean, smart, and efficient technologies. The combination of transport speed, selectivity, and structural control put them ahead of other nanostructures for various purposes.",

We show that, in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an antiferromagnetic coupling $J_4$ that arises between the honeycomb layers, rather than the expected interchain $J_3$ coupling in the layers. This finding reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme, $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$, for Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault model of the compound.",

    "summary": "Predicting quantum wavefunction probability distributions is crucial for computational chemistry and materials science, yet machine learning (ML) models often face a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. This study compares Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) in modeling quantum probability distributions for the H$_{2}^+$ ion, leveraging data generated via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While ANN achieved superior accuracy (R$^2$ = 0.99 vs ANFIS's 0.95 with Gaussian membership functions), it required over 50x more parameters (2,305 vs 39-45). ANFIS, however, provided unique interpretability: its Gaussian membership functions encoded spatial electron localization near proton positions ($\\mu = 1.2 A$), mirroring Born probability densities, while fuzzy rules reflected quantum superposition principles. Rules prioritizing the internuclear direction revealed the system's 1D symmetry, aligning with Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals theory--a novel data-driven perspective on orbital hybridization. Membership function variances ($\\sigma$) further quantified electron delocalization trends, and peak prediction errors highlighted unresolved quantum cusps. The choice of functions critically impacted performance: Gaussian/Generalized Bell outperformed Sigmoid, with errors improving as training data increased, showing scalability. This study underscores the context-dependent value of ML: ANN for precision and ANFIS for interpretable, parameter-efficient approximations that link inputs to physical behavior. These findings advocate hybrid approaches in quantum simulations, balancing accuracy with explainability to accelerate discovery. Future work should extend ANFIS to multi-electron systems and integrate domain-specific constraints (e.g., kinetic energy terms), bridging data-driven models and fundamental physics.",

    "summary": "Neural network quantum states emerge as a promising tool for solving quantum many-body problems. However, its successes and limitations are still not well-understood in particular for Fermions with complex sign structures. Based on our recent work [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 21, 10252-10262 (2025)], we generalizes the restricted Boltzmann machine to a more general class of states for Fermions, formed by product of `neurons' and hence will be referred to as neuron product states (NPS). NPS builds correlation in a very different way, compared with the closely related correlator product states (CPS) [H. J. Changlani, et al. Phys. Rev. B, 80, 245116 (2009)], which use full-rank local correlators. In constrast, each correlator in NPS contains long-range correlations across all the sites, with its representational power constrained by the simple function form. We prove that products of such simple nonlocal correlators can approximate any wavefunction arbitrarily well under certain mild conditions on the form of activation functions. In addition, we also provide elementary proofs for the universal approximation capabilities of feedforward neural network (FNN) and neural network backflow (NNBF) in second quantization. Together, these results provide a deeper insight into the neural network representation of many-body wavefunctions in second quantization.",

Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\\pi$-flux excitations, which enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation.

Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or large amounts of configurations, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as DFT. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires $3N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces, which is not negligible as the system size increases. This paper presents a way to replace the $3N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. This improves the computational cost and scalability of the method. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the corrected VMC forces with those obtained by the Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles with perturbative Triples [CCSD(T)] calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are significantly biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values much closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones.",

Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinite layer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.",

    "summary": "$n$-particle reduced density matrices ($n$-RDMs) play a central role in understanding correlated phases of matter. Yet the calculation of $n$-RDMs is often computationally inefficient for strongly-correlated states, particularly when the system sizes are large. In this work, we propose to use neural network (NN) architectures to accelerate the calculation of, and even predict, the $n$-RDMs for large-size systems. The underlying intuition is that $n$-RDMs are often smooth functions over the Brillouin zone (BZ) (certainly true for gapped states) and are thus interpolable, allowing NNs trained on small-size $n$-RDMs to predict large-size ones. Building on this intuition, we devise two NNs: (i) a self-attention NN that maps random RDMs to physical ones, and (ii) a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) that directly maps momentum-space coordinates to RDM values. We test the NNs in three 2D models: the pair-pair correlation functions of the Richardson model of superconductivity, the translationally-invariant 1-RDM in a four-band model with short-range repulsion, and the translation-breaking 1-RDM in the half-filled Hubbard model. We find that a SIREN trained on a $6\\times 6$ momentum mesh can predict the $18\\times 18$ pair-pair correlation function with a relative accuracy of $0.839$. The NNs trained on $6\\times 6 \\sim 8\\times 8$ meshes can provide high-quality initial guesses for $50\\times 50$ translation-invariant Hartree-Fock (HF) and $30\\times 30$ fully translation-breaking-allowed HF, reducing the number of iterations required for convergence by up to $91.63\\%$ and $92.78\\%$, respectively, compared to random initializations. Our results illustrate the potential of using NN-based methods for interpolable $n$-RDMs, which might open a new avenue for future research on strongly correlated phases.",

However, thorough characterization of SACs at the atomic scale remains challenging. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) offers unique advantages for the in-depth analysis of TiO2-supported SACs. By employing XAS, the local atomic structure, oxidation state, and electronic properties of the SACs, as well as the underlying photocatalytic mechanism, can be revealed. Herein, we present a short review on the application of XAS in studying TiO2-supported SACs. We first elucidate the key role of XAS in simultaneously probing the structure and electronic properties of monometallic SACs across different periods. Next, we discuss XAS studies of bimetallic SACs from the perspective of each constituent element and highlight the element-specific capabilities of XAS for analyzing multi-element SACs. Finally, we demonstrate how in situ XAS can effectively monitor structural and electronic property changes in SACs under real photocatalytic reaction conditions. Additionally, we provide practical suggestions for utilizing XAS more efficiently in the analysis of various SAC systems.",

    "summary": "Giorgio Parisi's exact solution of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, recognized with the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, revealed revolutionary hierarchical organization in disordered systems, yet systematic validation has remained computationally intractable beyond $N \\sim 100$ spins, and the topological limits of this complexity remain unexplored. Here we leverage quantum annealing to extend ground-state computations to 4000 spins and systematically probe both the emergence and breakdown of replica symmetry breaking. Three independent measurements validate core RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value $E_\\infty/N = -0.7633$ with predicted $N^{-2/3}$ finite-size corrections; chaos exponent $\\theta = 0.51 \\pm 0.02$ confirms mean-field square-root scaling ($R^2 = 0.989$); and state-space overlap distribution exhibits broad continuous structure ($\\sigma_q = 0.19$) characteristic of hierarchical landscape organization. We then investigate RSB robustness by introducing controlled network dilution via the Blume-Capel model with vacancy formation. Remarkably, hierarchical complexity remains invariant under 36\\% dilution, proving RSB is a topological property of network connectivity rather than spin density. Beyond a critical threshold in the range $0.8 < D_c < 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously as the system undergoes complete conversion to the all-vacancy state within a narrow parameter window an abrupt avalanche-driven transition where independent-vacancy mean-field theory correctly predicts the energy scale but fails to capture the cooperative dynamics. This comprehensive validation across thermodynamics, universality, landscape geometry, and topological limits establishes quantum advantage for probing fundamental statistical mechanics in complex systems relevant to neural networks, optimization, and materials science.",

Using symmetry analysis of the single-particle Green's function, we classify spectral functions by irreducible representations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Complementarily, we calculate the one-body reduced density matrix which allows us to reach both a qualitative description of charge distribution and an analysis of the state purity. Moreover, within the Tensor Network framework, we employ a Density Matrix Renormalization Group approach to confirm the presence of three distinct phases and their corresponding phase transitions. Our results highlight how symmetry-labelled spectral functions and effective orbital analysis provide accessible single-particle tools for probing correlation-driven insulating phases.",

    "summary": "Numerical simulations of strongly correlated fermions at finite temperature are essential for studying high-temperature superconductivity and other quantum many-body phenomena. The recently developed tangent-space tensor renormalization group (tanTRG) provides an efficient and accurate framework by representing thermal density operators as matrix product operators. However, the particle number generally varies during the cooling process. The conventional strategy of fine-tuning chemical potentials to reach a target filling is computationally demanding. Here we propose a fixed-$N$ tanTRG algorithm that stabilizes the average particle number by adaptively tuning the chemical potential within the imaginary-time evolution. We benchmark its accuracy on exactly solvable free fermions, and further apply it to the square-lattice Hubbard model. For hole-doped cases, we study the temperature evolution of charge and spin correlations, identifying several characteristic temperature scales for stripe formation. Our results establish fixed-$N$ tanTRG as an efficient and reliable tool for finite-temperature studies of correlated fermion systems.",

This approach is applicable across a wide range of on-site Coulomb interaction strengths $U/t$, ranging from weakly interacting systems ($U/t \\ll 1$) to strong correlations ($U/t > 8$). The predicted self-energy is transformed via Dyson's equation and analytic continuation to obtain the real-frequency Green's function, which allows access to the spectral function and density of states. This method can be used for nearest-neighbor interactions $t$ and long-range hopping terms $t'$, $t''$, and $t'''$.",

Here, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. These results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.",

    "summary": "Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are uniquely capable of providing exact simulations of quantum many-body systems. Unfortunately, the applications of a QMC simulation are limited because extracting dynamic properties requires solving the analytic continuation (AC) problem. Across the many fields that use QMC methods, there is no universally accepted analytic continuation algorithm for extracting dynamic properties, but many publications compare to the maximum entropy method. We investigate when entropy maximization is an acceptable approach. We show that stochastic sampling algorithms reduce to entropy maximization when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We investigate when is Bryan's controversial optimization algorithm [Bryan, Eur. Biophys. J. 18, 165-174 (1990)] for entropy maximization (sometimes known as the maximum entropy method) appropriate to use. We show that Bryan's algorithm is appropriate when the noise is near zero or when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We also investigate the mean squared error, finding a better scaling when the Bayesian prior is near the true solution than when the noise is near zero. We point to examples of improved data-driven Bayesian priors that have already leveraged this advantage. We support these results by solving the double Gaussian problem using both Bryan's algorithm and the newly formulated dual approach to entropy maximization [Chuna et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 58, 335203 (2025)].",

    "summary": "The interplay between unconventional density waves and exotic superconductivity has attracted growing interest. Kagome superconductors $A\\rm{V}_3\\rm{Sb}_5$ ($A = \\rm{K}, \\rm{Rb}, \\rm{Cs}$) offer a platform for studying quantum phase transitions and the resulting symmetry breaking. Among these quantum phases, the $4a_0$ stripe charge-density-wave (CDW) has been widely observed for $A=\\rm{Rb}$ and $\\rm{Cs}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. However, the microscopic origin of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW remains elusive, and no theoretical studies addressing this phenomenon have been reported so far. In this paper, we propose a microscopic mechanism for the emergence of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW. We analyze the CDW instability in the 12-site kagome lattice Hubbard model with the $2\\times2$ bond order driven by the paramagnon-interference mechanism by focusing on the short-range magnetic fluctuations due to the geometrical frustration of kagome lattice. We reveal that the nesting vector of the reconstructed Fermi surface, formed by the $2\\times 2$ bond order, gives rise to a $4a_0$-period CDW. Remarkably, the obtained stripe CDW is composed of both the off-site hopping integral modulations and on-site potentials. The real-space structure of the stripe CDW obtained here is in good qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed stripe pattern.",

    "summary": "Symmetry breaking (SB) has proven to be a powerful approach for describing quantum materials: strong correlation, mass renormalization, and complex phase transitions are among the phenomena that SB can capture, even when coupled to a mean-field-like theory. Traditionally, corrective schemes were required to account for these effects; however, SB has emerged as an alternative that can also successfully describe the intricate physics of quantum materials. Here, we explore spin SB on EuB6 and SmB6 and how its relation to the exchange field can determine onsite properties, depending on the type of symmetry breaking. Using spin-polarized Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with the r2SCAN functional, we systematically compare four magnetic configurations, one totally symmetric - non-magnetic (NM) configuration - and three with different types of symmetry breaking: ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM) and a paramagnetic (PM) configuration - modeled through a Special Quasirandom Structure (SQS) method - to capture local symmetry-breaking effects. Our results show that the PM configuration produces distinct magnetic environments for the rare-earth atoms, leading to different exchange fields. These, in turn, induce symmetry breaking in the electronic and magnetic properties of Eu and Sm. Those results provide an alternative explanation for the experimental results on both materials, EuB6 and SmB6, where X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) measurements suggest the presence of multiple atomic environments, previously attributed to a mixed-valence configuration.",

Combined with a spherical harmonic basis makes, this forms a strong inductive bias and makes for a data efficient model.

The total magnetic moment of 6.70 $\\mu_B$ agrees with experiment, and the calculated $4f$ density of states reproduces photoemission and Bremsstrahlung isochromat spectra. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy reaches 4.8 meV/f.u. when Coulomb correlations on both Ce 4$f$ and Co 3$d$ shells are included, in very good agreement with experimental data.

Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $\\pi/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom.

These interactions frustrate conventional magnetic order and give rise to rich collective behavior that continues to challenge both theory and experiment. While Kitaev physics has been extensively explored in the context of honeycomb magnets, direct evidence for its role in real materials remains scarce. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring low-dimensional electrical, magnetic, and correlated electronic phenomena, and provide a fertile ground for potential applications ranging from spintronics to multiferroic devices and quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate, through magneto-transmission, Faraday angle rotation, and magnetic circular dichroism measurements, that the magnetic excitation spectrum of NiI$_2$, a van der Waals multiferroic material, is more accurately captured by a Kitaev-based spin model than by the previously invoked helical spin framework.",

    "summary": "We investigate the quantum phases of higher-spin Kitaev models using tensor network methods. Our results reveal distinct bond-ordered phases for spin-1, spin-$\\tfrac{3}{2}$, and spin-2 models. In all cases, we find translational symmetry breaking with unit cells being tripled by forming valence-bond orders. However, these three phases are distinct, forming plaquette order, topological dimer order, and non-topological dimer order, respectively. Our findings are based on a cross-validation between variational two-dimensional tensor network calculations: an unrestricted exploration of symmetry-broken states versus the detection of symmetry breaking from cat-state behavior in symmetry-restricted states. The origin of different orders can also be understood from a theoretical analysis. Our work sheds light upon the interplay between topological and symmetry-breaking orders as well as their detection via tensor networks.",

    "summary": "Understanding the properties of two-dimensional materials interfaces with the substrate is necessary for device applications. Surface acoustic wave propagation through the layered material flake on a substrate could provide unique information on the transverse rigidity of the flake-to-substrate interaction. We generate ultrasonic waves by a focused femtosecond laser pulse at the surface of the model system -- fused silica with h-BN flake transferred above. Using an all-optical spatially resolved pump-probe interferometric technique, we measure the spatial dependencies of the surface vertical velocity profiles. Our measurements reveal the appearance of the surface acoustic wave dispersion in the hBN flake region compared to fused silica surface. Multilayer modeling allows us to gain access to longitudinal and shear elastic coupling constants $c^*_{33}$ and $c^*_{44}$ between hexagonal BN and substrate.",
