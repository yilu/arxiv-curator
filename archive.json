    "summary": "High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a hole $\\gamma$ pocket, or not. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming fluctuations for the leading $s_\\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge provided the maximum energy level of the $\\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.",

    "summary": "The ghost Gutzwiller ansatz (gGut) embedding technique was shown to achieve comparable accuracy to the gold standard dynamical mean-field theory method in simulating real material properties, yet at a much lower computational cost. Despite that, gGut is limited by the algorithmic bottleneck of computing the density matrix of the underlying effective embedding model, a quantity which must be converged within a self-consistent embedding loop. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical gGut technique which computes the ground state properties of embedding Hamiltonians with the help of a quantum computer, using the sample-based quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) algorithm. We study the applicability of SCI-based methods to the evaluation of the density of states for single-band Anderson impurity models within gGut and find that such ground states of interest become sufficiently sparse in the CI basis as the number of ghost orbitals is increased. Further, we investigate the performance of QSCI using local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) variational quantum states in combination with a circuit cutting technique, prepared on IQM's quantum hardware for system sizes of up to 11 ghost orbitals, equivalent to 24 qubits. We report converged gGut calculations which correctly capture the metal-to-insulator phase transition in the Fermi-Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice by using quantum samples to build an SCI basis with as little as $1\\%$ of the total CI basis states.",

Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally reported nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. To gain insight into the orbital feature of superconductivity, we explore the projection of different pairing bonds on Fermi surface. We find that the nodeless gap at $\\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, in which the latter is triggered by the former through hybridization, and both hold the same sign.",

    "summary": "DFT is vital for materials discovery, and at the base of extensive molecular and materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in chemistry and materials science aims for \"chemical accuracy,\" but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r r2SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r2SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r2SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r2SCANY@r2SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r2SCANY@r2SCANX utilizes different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r2SCANY@r2SCANX enhances the r2SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+U method. The O2 overbinding in r2SCAN (~0.3 eV/O2) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r2SCAN10@r2SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r2SCAN10@r2SCAN50, minimizing r2SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r2SCAN10@r2SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r2SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r2SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r2SCAN10@r2SCAN, which is 10 to 300 times faster than r2SCAN10.",

    "summary": "Free energy calculations are at the heart of physics-based analyses of biochemical processes. They allow us to quantify molecular recognition mechanisms, which determine a wide range of biological phenomena from how cells send and receive signals to how pharmaceutical compounds can be used to treat diseases. Quantitative and predictive free energy calculations require computational models that accurately capture both the varied and intricate electronic interactions between molecules as well as the entropic contributions from motions of these molecules and their aqueous environment. However, accurate quantum-mechanical energies and forces can only be obtained for small atomistic models, not for large biomacromolecules. Here, we demonstrate how to consistently link accurate quantum-mechanical data obtained for substructures to the overall potential energy of biomolecular complexes by machine learning in an integrated algorithm. We do so using a two-fold quantum embedding strategy where the innermost quantum cores are treated at a very high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the viability of this approach for the molecular recognition of a ruthenium-based anticancer drug by its protein target, applying traditional quantum chemical methods. As such methods scale unfavorable with system size, we analyze requirements for quantum computers to provide highly accurate energies that impact the resulting free energies. Once the requirements are met, our computational pipeline FreeQuantum is able to make efficient use of the quantum computed energies, thereby enabling quantum computing enhanced modeling of biochemical processes. This approach combines the exponential speedups of quantum computers for simulating interacting electrons with modern classical simulation techniques that incorporate machine learning to model large molecules.",

In order to clarify the structural, spectroscopic and theoretical details of that evolution, here we present ARPES data supplementing morphology and scanning tunneling measurements. These combined experimental results are compared with predictions from a variety of electronic structure approaches, mostly density functional DFT+U, but not neglecting Mott-Hubbard models, both ordered and disordered. These theoretical pictures address different spectroscopic aspects, including the 2D Fermi surface, the Hubbard bands, etc. While no single picture account for all observations at once,the emergent hypothesis compatible with all data is that metallization arises from sub-subsurface boron doping, additional to the main standard subsurface boron geometry, that would leave the surface insulating. These results advance the indispensable frame for the further understanding of this fascinating system.",

Starting from the Luttinger-Ward functional for the grand thermodynamic potential, we derive expressions of the Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity in a form suitable for numerical studies. They are applied to the weakly attractive Hubbard model in three dimensions to calculate the thermodynamic potentials numerically and continuously for the normal, pseudogap, and superconducting phases on the same footing. It is shown that the entry into the pseudogap phase is detectable as singularities of thermodynamic potentials, especially a discontinuity in the heat capacity.",

To clarify the impact of the supercurrent on magnetism and superconductivity near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, we study the two-dimensional Hubbard model based on a fluctuation exchange approximation for a current-carrying superconducting state. We show a supercurrent-induced antiferromagnetism and emergence of spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The former results from Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, suppression in the superconducting gap, and strong correlation effects beyond the mean-field theory.

Using a $4\\pi$ electrocyclization as an example, we show how Green's functions generalize the concepts of symmetry allowed and symmetry forbidden reactions even in the presence of strong multi-reference correlations. We demonstrate how symmetry forbidden reactions are characterized by strong multi-reference correlations, resulting in crossings of Green's function zeros rather than poles as MO-theory would predict. Taking into account Green's functions zeros, a topological invariant is introduced that captures symmetry protected crossings of poles or zeros. We discuss the effects of symmetry breaking and outline generalizations of our approach to reactions without any conserved spatial symmetries along the reaction path. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic application of modern topological methods to chemical reactions and can be generalized to reactions involving different spin states or to excited states.",

    "summary": "Inspired by the recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, we investigate the role of magnetism emerging from a hypothetical insulating $d^8$ parent state. We demonstrate that due to the interplay of superexchange and Hund's coupling, the system can be in a high-spin, low-spin or spin-gapped state. The low-spin state has singlets across the bilayer in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, with charge carriers in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Thus, at low energy scales, it behaves as an effective one band system when hole doped. By contrast, the high-spin state is a more robust, spin-1 antiferromagnet. Using Hartree-Fock methods, we find that for fixed interaction strength and doping, high-spin magnetism remains more robust than the low-spin counterpart. Whether this implies that the high spin state provides a stronger pairing glue, or more strongly competes with superconductivity remains an open question. Our analysis therefore underscores the importance of identifying the spin state for understanding superconductivity in nickelates.",

Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. Our results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and the nonlocal correlations with its quantum environment.",

At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\\pi}{\\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.",

By analyzing antisymmetrized, temperature-dependent RIXS spectra over a range of in-plane momentum transfers, we observe a clear suppression of low-energy spectral weight below T$_c$, indicative of superconducting gap formation. This suppression is most pronounced at small momentum transfers ($|\\boldsymbol{q}_\\parallel| \\leq 0.18$ r.l.u.) and corresponds to a gap size of approximately 2$\\Delta_0 \\sim$ 130 meV. Comparison with theoretical calculations of the momentum-dependent charge susceptibility supports a d-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap, while an isotropic s-wave gap fails to reproduce key experimental features. These findings establish RIXS as a powerful, bulk-sensitive probe of superconducting gap symmetry and highlight its utility for studying materials beyond the reach of surface-sensitive techniques such as ARPES and STM.",

The nonlinear conductivity, obtained in Green's function formalism, is decomposed into its quantum geometric constituents using a projector-based approach. In addition to the previously identified Berry curvature and interband quantum metric dipoles, we obtain a third term of quantum geometric origin, given by the momentum derivative of the $intraband$ quantum metric. This contribution, which we term the intraband quantum metric dipole, provides substantial corrections to the NLHE in topological magnets and becomes the dominant geometric term in topological antiferromagnets with gapped Dirac cones. Considering generalized 2D and 3D Weyl/Dirac Hamiltonians, describing a large class of topological band crossings with sizable quantum geometry, we derive analytical expressions of the NLHE, thereby revealing the individual contributions of the three quantum geometric terms. Combined with an exhaustive symmetry classification of all magnetic space groups, this analysis leads to the identification of several candidate materials expected to exhibit large intrinsic NLHE, including the antiferromagnets $\\text{Yb}_3\\text{Pt}_4$, $\\text{CuMnAs}$, and $\\text{CoNb}_3\\text{S}_6$, as well as the nodal-plane material $\\text{MnNb}_3\\text{S}_6$. Finally, our projector-based approach yields a compact expression for the NLHE in terms of momentum derivatives of the Bloch Hamiltonian matrix alone, enabling efficient numerical evaluation of each contribution in the aforementioned materials.",

The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in the ac-Josephson current.",

It has been extensively studied within the Hubbard model, where a quantum critical transition occurs at a finite temperature second-order critical point. This work investigates the Mott metal-insulator transition in a modified periodic Anderson model that may be viewed as a three-orbital lattice model including an interacting, localized orbital coupled to a delocalized conduction orbital via a second conduction orbital. This model could also be viewed as a bilayer model involving a conventional periodic Anderson model layer coupled to a metallic layer. Within the dynamical mean field theory, this model possesses a strictly zero temperature quantum critical point separating a Fermi liquid and a Mott insulating phase. By employing a simplified version of the dynamical mean field theory, namely, the two-site or linearized dynamical mean field theory, we provide an analytical estimate of the critical parameter strengths at which the transition occurs at zero temperature. We also provide an analytical estimate of the single-site von Neumann entanglement entropy. This measure can be used as a robust identifier for the phase transition. We extend these calculations to their cluster version to incorporate short-range, non-local spatial correlations and discuss their effects on the transition observed in this model.",

Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.",

    "summary": "Weak first-order pseudocriticality with approximate scale invariance has been observed in a variety of settings, including the intriguing case of deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. Recently, this has been interpreted as extremely slow flows (\"walking behavior\") for real-valued couplings in proximity to a bona fide critical point with complex-valued couplings, described by a complex conformal field theory (CFT). Here we study an SU($N$) generalization of the the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is a familiar model for deconfined criticality in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in 1+1 dimensions the model is located near a complex CFT, whose proximity can be tuned as a function of $N$. We employ state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations for continuous $N$ along with an improved loop estimator for the R\\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy based on a nonequilibrium work protocol. These techniques allow us to track the central charge of this model in detail as a function of $N$, where we observe excellent agreement with CFT predictions. Notably, this includes the region $N>2$, where the CFT moves into the complex plane and pseudocritical drifts enable us to recover the real part of the complex central charge with remarkable accuracy. Since the present model with $N=3$ is also equivalent to the spin-1 biquadratic model, our work sheds new light on the dimerized phase of the spin-1 chain, demonstrating that it is pseudocritical and proximate to a complex CFT.",

The charge carriers occupy the wide bands of $x^2-y^2$ symmetry, and their Cooper pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$ band filling increases, i.e. moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation.

Recent research indicates that these orders can intertwine, with the superconducting order parameter coupling to modulations in the electronic density. To elucidate this interplay, we study a two-dimensional XY model with a periodic modulation of the coupling strength in one spatial direction. Using a combination of tensor network methods and Monte Carlo simulations, we reveal a non-monotonic, dome-like dependence of $T_c$ on the modulation wavelength, with the peak $T_c$ shifting to longer wavelengths as the modulation strength grows. The origin of this phenomenon is traced back to an effective pinning of vortices in the valleys of the modulation, confirmed by a comparison to modulated $q$-state clock models. These findings shed new light on the phase behavior of intertwined superconducting and charge-ordered states, offering a deeper understanding of their complex interactions.",

Electron doping exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong correlations.",

In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \\sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.",

Using perturbative Green's function methods, we examine an $s$-$d$ model on a geometrically frustrated lattice with noncollinear spin texture that breaks time-reversal and parity symmetries, leading to spin-triplet pairing correlations. The effective Josephson tunneling in the presence of such an exchange field leads to an anisotropic Josephson coupling between $d$-vectors, which prefers a spatially inhomogeneous pairing order. Furthermore, we discuss anomalous vortices arising from the spatially inhomogeneous $d$-vector in the absence of a magnetic field for nonunitary triplet pairing order. We also propose a Josephson diode effect in which the diode efficiency is proportional to the spin chirality of the local exchange field. Our results can help understand the experiments in superconducting proximitized Mn$_3$Ge and in 4Hb-TaS$_2$.",

This phase is originated from critical charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition.

    "summary": "Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\\text{K}_2\\text{Co}(\\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.",

In the limit of strong interactions we reproduce the antiferromagnetic 3-sublattice ordered state previously identified in the SU(3) Heisenberg model. At intermediate interaction strength we find antiferromagnetic states exhibiting zigzag patterns of different lengths, in agreement with previous Hartree-Fock and constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We study the color order parameter and energy anisotropy, which are discontinuous across the phase transitions. Finally, we analyze the different energy contributions in two competing phases, identifying low-energy bonds at the corners of the zigzag that help stabilize the zigzag states.",

    "summary": "The optical spectra of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are dominated by tightly bound excitons and trions. In the low doping limit, trions are often described as three-body quasiparticles consisting of two electrons and one hole or vice versa. However, trions are more rigorously understood as quasiparticles arising from the interaction between an exciton and excitation of the Fermi sea - referred to as exciton Fermi polaron. Here we employ pump-probe spectroscopy to directly observe the formation of exciton Fermi polarons in a model system composed of a WSe2 monolayer adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). Following the pump-injection of Rydberg excitons in WSe2, a time-delayed probe pulse tracks the development of Rydberg exciton Fermi polarons as interactions with localized carriers in the tBLG moire superlattice evolve. Both the exciton Fermi polaron relaxation rate and binding energy are found to increase with electron or hole density. Our findings provide insight into the optical response of fundamental excitations in 2D Van der Waals systems and reveal how many-body interactions give rise to emergent quasiparticles.",

Using a valence bond solid ansatz corroborated by density matrix renormalization group simulations, we investigate the nature of magnon and spinon excitations through the single-mode approximation. We show that the magnon develops an incommensurate dispersion at $J_2 \\approx 0.32J_1$, while the spinons, viewed as domain walls between degenerate valence bond solid states, become incommensurate at $J_2 \\approx 0.4J_1$ beyond the Lifshitz point ($J_2 \\approx 0.388J_1$). The dynamical structure factor exhibits rich spectral features shaped by the interplay between these excitations, with magnons appearing as resonances embedded in the spinon continuum. The spinon gap shows a nonmonotonic behavior, reaching a peak near the center of the partially dimerized phase and closing at the boundaries, suggesting the appearance of a floating phase as a result of the condensation of incommensurate spinons. Comparative analysis with the spin-$5/2$ case confirms the universality of these phenomena across half-integer higher-spin systems. Our results provide detailed insight into how fractionalization and incommensurate condensation govern the spectral properties of frustrated spin chains, offering a unified picture across different spin magnitudes.",

We find that the introduction of hydrogen at the apical oxygen vacancy position strongly influences the Wannier function corresponding to the effective interstitial orbital at the Ni site bound to the hydrogen. This results in the near disappearance of the electron pocket at the $k_z$ = $\\pi$ Fermi surface, keeping that of $k_z$ = 0 unchanged, compared to the dehydrogenated case. The two-band model thus remains valid even in the presence of H. The calculated superconducting order parameters both in absence and presence of H, show a two-hump superconductivity arising the two overlapping domes, one arising from $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and another arising from interstitial orbital degree of freedom. Hydrogenation strengthens the latter, marginally affecting the former.",

    "summary": "The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\\lesssim 2\\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.",

We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.",

Specifically, we study the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Kagome lattice, a geometrically frustrated structure that gives rise to a highly degenerate energy spectrum. To successfully simulate this system, we employ a qubit reduction strategy leveraging the Contextual Subspace methodology, significantly reducing the problem size prior to execution on the quantum device. We improve the quality of these subspaces by using the wavefunctions obtained from low bond dimension Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations to bias the subspace stabilizers through a symplectic approximate symmetry generator extraction algorithm. Reducing the Hamiltonian size allows us to implement tiled circuit ensembles and deploy the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to estimate the ground state energy. We adopt a hybrid quantum error mitigation strategy combining Readout Error Mitigation (REM), Symmetry Verification (SV) and Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). This approach yields high-accuracy energy estimates, achieving error rates on the order of 0.01% and thus demonstrating the potential of near-term quantum devices for probing frustrated quantum materials.",

    "summary": "In quantum many-body physics, one aims to understand emergent phenomena and effects of strong interactions, ideally by developing a simple theoretical picture. Recently, progress in quantum simulators has enabled the measurement of site resolved snapshots of Fermi-Hubbard systems at finite doping on square as well as triangular lattice geometries. These experimental advances pose the quest for theorists to analyze the ensuing data in order to gain insights into these prototypical, strongly correlated many-body systems. Here we employ machine learning techniques to optimize the mean-field parameters of a resonating valence bond (RVB) state through comparison with experimental data, thus determining a possible underlying simple model that is physically motivated and fully interpretable. We find that the resulting RVB states are capable of capturing two- as well as three-point correlations measured in experiments, even when they are not specifically used in the optimization. The analysis of the mean-field parameters and their doping dependence can be used to obtain physical insights and shed light on the nature of possible underlying quantum spin liquid states. Our results show that finite temperature data from Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators can be well captured by RVB states. This work paves the way for a new, systematic analysis of data from numerical as well as quantum simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.",

    "summary": "Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems have emerged as a powerful framework for describing open quantum systems, non-equilibrium dynamics, and engineered quantum optical materials. However, solving the ground-state properties of NH systems is challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space, and exotic phenomena such as the emergence of exceptional points. Another challenge arises from the limitations of traditional methods like exact diagonalization (ED). For the past decade, neural networks (NN) have shown promise in approximating many-body wavefunctions, yet their application to NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore different NN architectures to investigate the ground-state properties of a parity-time-symmetric, one-dimensional NH, transverse field Ising model with a complex spectrum by employing a recurrent neural network (RNN), a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). We construct the NN-based many-body wavefunctions and validate our approach by recovering the ground-state properties of the model for small system sizes, finding excellent agreement with ED. Furthermore, for larger system sizes, we demonstrate that the RNN outperforms both the RBM and MLP. However, we show that the accuracy of the RBM and MLP can be significantly improved through transfer learning, allowing them to perform comparably to the RNN for larger system sizes. These results highlight the potential of neural network-based approaches--particularly for accurately capturing the low-energy physics of NH quantum systems.",

    "summary": "Advancing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology into the sub-1-nm angstr\\\"om-scale technology nodes is expected to involve alternative semiconductor channel materials, as silicon transistors encounter severe performance degradation at physical gate lengths below 10 nm. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have emerged as strong candidates for overcoming short-channel effects due to their atomically thin bodies, which inherently suppress electrostatic leakage and improve gate control in aggressively scaled field-effect transistors (FETs). Among the growing library of 2D materials, the MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family -- a synthetic septuple-layered materials -- has attracted increasing attention for its remarkable ambient stability, suitable bandgaps, and favorable carrier transport characteristics, making it a promising platform for next-generation transistors. While experimental realization of sub-10-nm 2D FETs remains technologically demanding, computational device simulation using first-principles density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function transport simulations provide a powerful and cost-effective route for exploring the performance limits and optimal design of ultrascaled FET. This review consolidates the current progress in the computational design of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. We review the physical properties of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ that makes them compelling candidates for transistor applications, as well as the simulated device performance and optimization strategy of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FETs. Finally, we identify key challenges and research gaps, and outline future directions that could accelerate the practical deployment of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ family FET in the angstr\\\"om-scale CMOS era.",

In this computational study, we used charge-informed molecular dynamics with a fine-tuned CHGNet foundation potential to investigate the phase transformation in Li$_{x}$Mn$_{0.8}$Ti$_{0.1}$O$_{1.9}$F$_{0.1}$. Our results indicate that transition metal migration occurs and reorders to form the spinel-like ordering in an FCC anion framework. The transformed structure contains a higher concentration of non-transition metal (0-TM) face-sharing channels, which are known to improve Li transport kinetics. Analysis of the Mn valence distribution suggests that the appearance of tetrahedral Mn$^{2+}$ is a consequence of spinel-like ordering, rather than the trigger for cation migration as previously believed. Calculated equilibrium intercalation voltage profiles demonstrate that the $\\delta$-phase, unlike the ordered spinel, exhibits solid-solution signatures during the 0-TM to Li$_{\\text{tet}}$ conversion reaction. A higher Li capacity is obtained than in the DRX phase. This study provides atomic insights into solid-state phase transformation and its relation to experimental electrochemistry, highlighting the potential of charge-informed machine learning interatomic potentials for understanding complex oxide materials.",

    "summary": "Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.",

    "summary": "The development of machine-learning models for atomic-scale simulations has benefited tremendously from the large databases of materials and molecular properties computed in the past two decades using electronic-structure calculations. More recently, these databases have made it possible to train universal models that aim at making accurate predictions for arbitrary atomic geometries and compositions. The construction of many of these databases was however in itself aimed at materials discovery, and therefore targeted primarily to sample stable, or at least plausible, structures and to make the most accurate predictions for each compound - e.g. adjusting the calculation details to the material at hand. Here we introduce a dataset designed specifically to train machine learning models that can provide reasonable predictions for arbitrary structures, and that therefore follows a different philosophy. Starting from relatively small sets of stable structures, the dataset is built to contain massive atomic diversity (MAD) by aggressively distorting these configurations, with near-complete disregard for the stability of the resulting configurations. The electronic structure details, on the other hand, are chosen to maximize consistency rather than to obtain the most accurate prediction for a given structure, or to minimize computational effort. The MAD dataset we present here, despite containing fewer than 100k structures, has already been shown to enable training universal interatomic potentials that are competitive with models trained on traditional datasets with two to three orders of magnitude more structures. We describe in detail the philosophy and details of the construction of the MAD dataset. We also introduce a low-dimensional structural latent space that allows us to compare it with other popular datasets and that can be used as a general-purpose materials cartography tool.",

    "summary": "Raman spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for characterizing molecules and materials that is used in many laboratories. First-principles theoretical calculations of Raman spectra are important because they elucidate the microscopic effects underlying Raman activity in these systems. These calculations are often performed using the canonical harmonic approximation which cannot capture certain thermal changes in the Raman response. Anharmonic vibrational effects were recently found to play crucial roles in several materials, which motivates theoretical treatments of the Raman effect beyond harmonic phonons. While Raman spectroscopy from molecular dynamics (MD-Raman) is a well-established approach that includes anharmonic vibrations and further relevant thermal effects, MD-Raman computations were long considered to be computationally too expensive for practical materials computations. In this perspective article, we highlight that recent advances in the context of machine learning have now dramatically accelerated the involved computational tasks without sacrificing accuracy or predictive power. These recent developments highlight the increasing importance of MD-Raman and related methods as versatile tools for theoretical prediction and characterization of molecules and materials.",

We vastly enhanced visibility of grains with ion beam treatment and performed accurate grain segmentation using deep neural network (DNN). By leveraging our new method, we discovered unexpected discrepancies that contradict previous results, such as deposition temperature (Tdep) and post-metallization annealing (PMA) dependence of grain size statistics, prompting us to reassess earlier interpretations. Combining microstructural analysis with electrical tests, we found that grain size reduction had both positive and negative outcomes: it caused significant diminishing of die-to-die variation (~68 % decrease in standard deviation) in coercive field (Ec), while triggering an upsurge in leakage current. These uncovered results signify robustness of our method in characterization of ferroelectric hafnia for in-depth examination of both device variability and reliability.",

In magnetically ordered materials, magnons - the quanta of spin waves - exhibit intrinsic nonlinearities that are of great interest in fundamental research and practical applications. Despite progress in the nonlinear control of magnon modes in antiferromagnetic materials, the transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regimes of magnon coherences has remained elusive. Here, we explore the nonlinear dynamics of a magnon mode in an antiferromagnet using two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy with waveguide-enhanced terahertz fields. By driving the magnon mode far from equilibrium, we demonstrate the emergence of high-order magnon coherences and delineate a distinct transition into non-perturbative magnon nonlinearities. This behavior originates from the intrinsic anharmonicity of the magnetic potential and marks a regime dominated by magnon self-interactions at large spin deflection angles. These findings provide fundamental mechanistic insights that might be exploited for ultrafast switching and other advanced magnonic applications.",

Achieving optimal growth conditions requires precise control of process and furnace design parameters. Still, data scarcity -- especially for new materials -- limits the application of machine learning (ML) in predictive modeling and optimization. This study proposes a transfer learning approach to overcome this limitation by adapting ML models trained on a higher data volume of one source material (Si) to a lower data volume of another target material (Ge and GaAs). The materials were deliberately selected to assess the robustness of the transfer learning approach in handling varying data similarity, with Cz-Ge being similar to Cz-Si, and GaAs grown via the liquid encapsulated Czochralski method (LEC), which differs from Cz-Si. We explore various transfer learning strategies, including Warm Start, Merged Training, and Hyperparameters Transfer, and evaluate multiple ML architectures across two different materials. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly enhances predictive accuracy with minimal data, providing a practical framework for optimizing Cz growth parameters across diverse materials.",

    "summary": "Large-scale foundation models, including neural network interatomic potentials (NIPs) in computational materials science, have demonstrated significant potential. However, despite their success in accelerating atomistic simulations, NIPs face challenges in directly predicting electronic properties and often require coupling to higher-scale models or extensive simulations for macroscopic properties. Machine learning (ML) offers alternatives for structure-to-property mapping but faces trade-offs: feature-based methods often lack generalizability, while deep neural networks require significant data and computational power. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HackNIP, a two-stage pipeline that leverages pretrained NIPs. This method first extracts fixed-length feature vectors (embeddings) from NIP foundation models and then uses these embeddings to train shallow ML models for downstream structure-to-property predictions. This study investigates whether such a hybridization approach, by ``hacking\" the NIP, can outperform end-to-end deep neural networks, determines the dataset size at which this transfer learning approach surpasses direct fine-tuning of the NIP, and identifies which NIP embedding depths yield the most informative features. HackNIP is benchmarked on Matbench, evaluated for data efficiency, and tested on diverse tasks including \\textit{ab initio}, experimental, and molecular properties. We also analyze how embedding depth impacts performance. This work demonstrates a hybridization strategy to overcome ML trade-offs in materials science, aiming to democratize high-performance predictive modeling.",

    "summary": "Polycrystalline materials have numerous applications due to their unique properties, which are often determined by the grain boundaries. Hence, quantitative characterization of grain as well as interface orientation is essential to optimize these materials, particularly energy materials. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy, matter can be analysed in an extremely fine grid of scan points via electron diffraction patterns at each scan point. By matching the diffraction patterns to a simulated database, the crystal orientation of the material as well as the orientation of the grain boundaries at each scan point can be determined. This pattern matching approach is highly time intensive. Artificial intelligence promises to be a very powerful tool for pattern recognition. In this work, we train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on dynamically simulated diffraction patterns of LiNiO2, an important cathode-active material for Lithium-ion batteries, to predict the orientation of grains in terms of three Euler angles for the complete fundamental orientation region. Results demonstrate that these networks outperform the conventional pattern matching algorithm with increased accuracy and efficiency. The increased accuracy of the CNN models can be attributed to the fact that these models are trained by data incorporating dynamical effects. This work is the first attempt to apply deep learning for analysis of electron diffraction data and enlightens the great potential of ML to accelerate the analysis of electron microscopy data, toward high-throughput characterization technique.",

Conventional benchmarking methods (e.g., charge transport, confocal mapping, electron or scanning probe microscopy) are slow, perturb sample quality, or involve trade-offs between speed, resolution, and scan area. To accelerate assessment of 2D semiconductors, we demonstrate a broadband, wide-field hyperspectral optical microscope for 2D materials (2D-HOM) that rapidly captures a spatial-spectral data cube within seconds. The data cube includes x-y spatial coordinate (a 300 * 300 $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$ field, with ~ 1 $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ resolution) and a selectable wavelength range between 1100 to 200 nm at each pixel. Using synthesized films and heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides ($\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{WS}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{V}_{x}\\mathrm{W}_{1-x}\\mathrm{S}_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{WSe}_{2}$), we show that this cost-effective technique detects spectral fingerprints of material identity, doping, grain boundaries, and alloy composition, and enables advanced analysis, including unsupervised machine learning for spatial segmentation.",

Here, through the combination of first principles dynamical mean field theory calculations and epitaxial growth of the single-layer FeX (X=Se, S, Te) on SrTiO$_3$ (STO)(001) substrate, which facilitates the controlled distortion of the FeX$_4$ tetrahedron, we demonstrate an unique superconducting dome where the superconducting gap peaks at a `magic' angle of the FeX$_4$ tetrahedron and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) for the A$_{1g}$ mode is maximized for the FeSe film. Our findings uncover a significant role of electronic correlations in strengthening Cooper pairing in unconventional superconductors by enhancing EPC.",

Using a self-consistent hybridization expansion based on the Non-Crossing Approximation (NCA) we compute the dynamics of the impurity, its steady-state and spectral function. We show that the interplay between strong Coulomb repulsion and correlated dissipation gives rise to robust signatures of Kondo physics both at weak and strong losses. These include a strongly suppressed spin relaxation rate, displaying a characteristic Kondo-Zeno crossover and a spectral function where doublon band is quickly destroyed by dissipation while the coherent Kondo peak remains visible for weak losses, then disappears at intermediate values and finally re-emerge as the system enters in the Kondo-Zeno regime. As compared to the case of single particle losses we show that two-body dissipation protects Kondo physics. The picture obtained with NCA is confirmed by numerical simulations of exact dynamics on finite-size chains. We interpret these results using a dissipative Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which leads to an effective Kondo model with residual impurity-bath losses which are suppressed by strong correlations or strong losses.",

We analyze the resulting logical operators, whose existence depends on the system size, as well as the structure of gapped boundaries and a tensor network representation of the ground state. Furthermore, when confinement is enforced in both directions, fractal-like excitations emerge, resulting in unpaired logical operators.   We extend our construction to 3D models, such as the surface code and the X-cube model, leading to novel dipole-loop and dipole-planon excitations that arise from bounding confined excitations. These modifications are implemented through group cohomological twistings--projective representations of finite groups--with most examples based on Z2xZ2.",

In this work we will present an implementation of non-collinear TDDFT for the INQ code to simulate spin dynamics in real time and discuss the implementation of non-collinear magnetic effects into the code. We will discuss the implementation of exchange-correlation magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling, and the interaction between the electronic system and external magnetic fields. We will then consider several prototypical examples of spin dynamics in magnetic clusters and solids after light excitation. Potential applications range from the study of real-time dynamics of magnons to ultrafast spin dynamics under linear and circularly polarized laser excitation, as well as spectroscopic signatures such as magnetic circular dichroism and pump-probe Kerr rotation.",

To tackle challenges of processing multi-source, multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions. Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging, yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration. Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter, Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.",

The photonic crystals are composed of alternating mesoporous SiO$_2$ and dense TiO$_2$ layers, providing a high refractive index contrast ($\\sim$0.8). This enables strong reflectance (up to 96%) with as few as five bilayers and precise control of the photonic stop band across the visible spectrum by simply adjusting the deposition parameters. Integration of a thin film of the two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$ leads to strong light--matter coupling at room temperature. Angle-resolved reflectance and photoluminescence measurements reveal the formation of upper and lower polariton branches, with a Rabi splitting of 90 meV. The observed polaritonic dispersion is well described by a two-level system and Green's function formalism. This work demonstrates an efficient strategy for constructing tunable optical cavities using simple solution-based methods. The combination of high optical quality, spectral tunability, and strong coupling performance positions this platform as a promising candidate for low-threshold polariton lasers, nonlinear optics, and integrated optoelectronic devices.",

    "summary": "We investigate the magnetotransport properties of a diluted half-filled one-band Hubbard model with second-nearest-neighbor hopping on a simple cubic lattice, aiming to explore the possibility of metallicity in diluted antiferromagnetic systems. Our semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials. This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that when the on-site repulsion strength ($U$) is set to zero on a percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably, this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.",

CrMnSb, having a valence electron count of 18, has been proposed to exhibit compensated ferrimagnetic character instead of the expected nonmagnetic semiconducting ground state. As half-Heusler systems with a valence electron count of 18 are not known to exhibit magnetic ordering, we have investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of CrMnSb using a combination of density functional theory and Green's function-based multiple-scattering theory. We show that, despite satisfying the 18 valence electron Slater-Pauling rule, CrMnSb does not exhibit ground-state nonmagnetic semiconducting behavior. Instead, it reveals a half-metallic, fully compensated ferrimagnetic ground state. This anomaly originates from the presence of localized sublattice moments, resulting from antiparallel alignment between Cr and Mn sublattices, which enforces half-metallic ferrimagnetism despite its ideal 18 valence electron count.",

We performed a comprehensive search for new hard magnetic materials in the ternary Fe-Co-Zr space by leveraging a scalable, machine learning-assisted materials discovery framework running on GPU-enabled exascale computing resources. This framework integrates crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN) machine learning (ML) method with first-principles calculations to efficiently navigate the vast composition-structure space. The efficiency and accuracy of the ML approach enable us to reveal 9 new thermodynamically stable ternary Fe-Co-Zr compounds and 81 promising low-energy metastable phases with their formation energies within 0.1 eV/atom above the convex hull. The predicted compounds span a wide range of crystal symmetries and magnetic behaviors, providing a rich platform for tuning functional properties. Based on the analysis of site-specific magnetic properties, we show that the Fe6Co17Zr6 compound obtained from our ML discovery can be further optimized by chemical doping. Chemical substitutions lead to a ternary Fe5Co18Zr6 phase with a strong anisotropy of K1 = 1.1 MJ/m3, and a stable quaternary magnetic Fe5Co16Zr6Mn4 compound.",

A machine learning framework is developed to accelerate the parameterization of interatomic force fields (FFs), enabling molecular dynamics simulations of three nanocrystalline models: (i) a meta-atom (MA) mode representing the RHEA as a hypothetical sing-element system with averaged properties, (ii) a quinary RSS model with randomly distributed constituent atoms, and (iii) a Monte Carlo (MC) model with internal CSRO. The results reveal that RSS enhances strength, while CSRO reduces flow stress level but improves strain hardening and failure resistance. A transition from Hall-Petch (HP) strengthening to inverse Hall-Petch (IHP) softening is observed, with CSRO suppressing this transition. The underlying plastic mechanisms (i.e., dislocation slip, deformation twinning, phase transformation and grain boundary movements) are analyzed from both nanostructural and energetic perspectives. Theoretical models are established to describe the size-dependent yield strength and predict the critical grain size. Additionally, the contributions of different plastic mechanisms to the overall stress response are separately quantified. These findings provide new insights into the design and performance optimization of RHEAs through nanostructural engineering.",

However, the structural and electronic properties of La$_2$NiO$_4$ under pressure and doping remain surprisingly underexplored. Here, we investigate these properties using density-functional-theory calculations. We find that its tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure can be stabilized, not only under comparatively low pressures of $\\sim$ 8 GPa, but also at ambient pressure via the partial substitution of La with Ba. Moreover, we show that the combined effects of Ba substitution and pressure leads to qualitative changes in the electronic structure towards the formal $d^{7.5}$ configuration of the superconducting bilayer nickelates. Further, while La$_2$NiO$_4$ can undergo a insulator-metal transition with pressure retaining G-type antiferromagnetic order, La$_{1.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$NiO$_4$ exhibits metallic behavior with an enhanced competition between different magnetic states. Our results thus offer new insights into the interplay of structure, doping, and magnetism across the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate series.",

This new setup was tested on a variety of samples. We present results on the metal-insulator transition in InAs and we report notably the first observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations in WTe$_{2}$ at magnetic fields beyond 100 T.",

    "summary": "Geometric frustration is a key ingredient in the emergence of exotic states of matter, such as the quantum spin liquid in Mott insulators. While there has been intense interest in experimentally tuning frustration in candidate materials, achieving precise and continuous control has remained a major hurdle -- particularly in accessing the properties of the ideally frustrated lattice. Here, we show that large, finely controlled anisotropic strains can effectively tune the degree of geometric frustration in the Mott insulating $\\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ -- a slightly anisotropic triangular-lattice quantum magnet. Using thermodynamic measurements of the elastocaloric effect, we experimentally map out a temperature-strain phase diagram that captures both the ground state of the isotropic lattice and the less frustrated parent state. Our results provide a new benchmark for calculations of the triangular-lattice Hubbard model as a function of frustration and highlight the power of lattice engineering as a route to realizing perfectly frustrated quantum materials.",

We focus on the low-temperature scaling of normalized spin current $\\tilde{I}_S$ through the interface, and benchmark our approach on 1D Heisenberg chain, with the negative spinon spin current reproduced. In addition, we find an algebraic scaling $\\tilde{I}_S \\sim T^{\\alpha}$ with varying exponent $\\alpha$ in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with characteristic spin-current signatures distinguishing different magnetic phases. Remarkably, we discover a persistent spin current $\\tilde{I}_S$ in the spin supersolid phase, which saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $\\tilde{I}_S \\sim T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence in SSE - provide sensitive experimental probes for investigating spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Moreover, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.",

Performing counting measurements on the environment gives rise to stochastic dynamics of quantum trajectories for the system, which when averaged yield back the quantum master equation. In this work, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions under which the dynamics of these different descriptions retain the weak symmetry of the quantum master equation and we characterise the resulting symmetries of the different descriptions in terms of their generators. We find that the joint dynamics always features a separable symmetry directly related to that of the quantum master equation, but for quantum trajectories the corresponding symmetry is present only if the counting measurement satisfies certain conditions.",

However, its application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group scheme tailored for the contraction of such triple-layer networks, which reduces the computational complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(D^{12})$ in conventional methods to $\\mathcal{O}(D^{9})$. Through numerical benchmarks on the three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo simulations, while also providing a substantial speedup over previous variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network simulations.",

This extension employs complete non-exponential basis expansions for the bath correlation functions, thereby generalizing the applicability of the cNMSSE framework beyond environments with Debye-type spectral structures. By preserving the wavefunction-based description and favorable linear-scaling properties, the extended cNMSSE offers an efficient and flexible approach to simulate non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The method is implemented within a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved numerically via matrix product state (MPS) techniques. Benchmark simulations on four representative cases, including discrete spectra, Ohmic spectra with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral densities, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward-backward stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM). The extended cNMSSE thus provides a robust and scalable framework for accurate simulations of non-Markovian open quantum systems with general environments.",

In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.",

    "summary": "Free theories are landmarks in the landscape of quantum field theories: their exact solvability serves as a pillar for perturbative constructions of interacting theories. Fuzzy sphere regularization, which combines quantum Hall physics with state-operator correspondence, has recently been proposed as a promising framework for simulating three-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), but so far it has not provided access to free theories. We overcome this limitation by designing a bilayer quantum Hall system that hosts an Ising tricritical point -- a nontrivial fixed point where first-order and second-order transitions meet -- which flows to the conformally coupled scalar theory in the infrared. The critical energy spectrum and operator structure match those at the Gaussian fixed point, providing nonperturbative evidence for the emergence of a free scalar CFT. Our results expand the landscape of CFTs realizable on the fuzzy sphere and demonstrate that even free bosonic theories -- previously inaccessible -- can emerge from interacting electrons in this framework.",

This gives a formal setting for topological holography, where the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules of the physical boundary algebra captures the bulk topological order.   In this article, we extend the LTO axioms to quantum spin systems equipped with a topological boundary, again producing a physical boundary algebra for the bulk-boundary system, whose category of (topological) boundary DHR bimodules recovers the topological boundary order. We perform this analysis in explicit detail for Levin-Wen and Walker-Wang bulk-boundary systems.   Along the way, we introduce a 2D braided categorical net of algebras built from a unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). Such nets arise as boundary algebras of Walker-Wang models. We consider the canonical state on this braided categorical net corresponding to the standard topological boundary for the Walker-Wang model. Interestingly, in this state, the cone von Neumann algebras are type I with finite dimensional centers, in contrast with the type II and III cone von Neumann algebras from the Levin-Wen models studied in [arXiv:2307.12552]. Their superselection sectors recover the underlying unitary category of our UBFC, and we conjecture the superselection category also captures the fusion and braiding.",

Recognizing that unitary matrices form a mathematical manifold, we employ Riemannian optimization methods -- specifically the Riemannian trust-region algorithm -- which involves second derivative calculations with respect to the gates. Our key technical contribution is a matrix-free algorithmic framework that avoids the explicit construction and storage of large unitary matrices acting on the whole Hilbert space. Instead, we evaluate all quantities as sums over state vectors, assuming that these vectors can be stored in memory. We develop HPC-optimized kernels for applying gates to state vectors and for the gradient and Hessian computation. Further improvements are achieved by exploiting sparsity structures due to Hamiltonian conservation laws, such as parity conservation, and lattice translation invariance. We benchmark our implementation on the Fermi-Hubbard model with up to 16 sites, demonstrating a nearly linear parallelization speed-up with up to 112 CPU threads. Finally, we compare our implementation with an alternative matrix product operator-based approach.",

We present advances in the research program of causal decompositions, which investigates the existence of an equivalence between the causal and the compositional structures of unitary channels. Our results concern one-dimensional Quantum Cellular Automata (1D QCAs), i.e. unitary channels over a line of $N$ quantum systems (with or without periodic boundary conditions) that feature a causality radius $r$: a given input cannot causally influence outputs at a distance more than $r$. We prove that, for $N \\geq 4r + 1$, 1D QCAs all admit causal decompositions: a unitary channel is a 1D QCA if and only if it can be decomposed into a unitary routed circuit of nearest-neighbour interactions, in which its causal structure is compositionally obvious. This provides the first constructive form of 1D QCAs with causality radius one or more, fully elucidating their structure. In addition, we show that this decomposition can be taken to be translation-invariant for the case of translation-invariant QCAs. Our proof of these results makes use of innovative algebraic techniques, leveraging a new framework for capturing partitions into non-factor sub-C* algebras.",

We investigate the effectiveness of several quantum error mitigation strategies, including self-mitigation, by simulating quantum quench dynamics for Heisenberg spin chains with system sizes up to 104 qubits using IBM quantum processors. In particular, we discuss the limitations of zero-noise extrapolation and the advantages offered by self-mitigation at a large scale. The self-mitigation method shows stable accuracy with the large systems of 104 qubits with more than 3,000 CNOT gates. Also, we combine the discussed quantum error mitigation methods with practical entanglement entropy measuring methods, and it shows a good agreement with the theoretical estimation. Our study illustrates the usefulness of near-term noisy quantum hardware in examining the quantum quench dynamics of many-body systems at large scales, and lays the groundwork for surpassing classical simulations with quantum methods prior to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.",

While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD) protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange, continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light, offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks. This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings, technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations, improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols. These developments, combined with ongoing improvements in quantum photonic integration, pave the way for the practical deployment of large-scale, high-speed quantum-secure networks.",

We also introduce MTDMRG-X, a new algorithm that combines DMRG-X with multi-target DMRG to efficiently compute excited states even in regimes with strong eigenstate hybridization. We showcase the use of these methods for the analysis of long-range couplings in a multi-transmon Hamiltonian including qubits and couplers, and we discuss eigenstate localization.

    "summary": "Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank parameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we demonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly, we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover certain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require the density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm requires just $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d \\times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.",

Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one U(1) conserved quantity.",

As a critical many-body state, we focus on the critical transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) described by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT). We show that even if we modify the non-selective projective measurement assumed in R\\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information by replacing the measurement into decoherence by environment, the R\\'{e}nyi generalized Shannon mutual information maintains the CFT properties such as subsystem CFT scaling law and its central charge observed through both the conventional R\\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information and R\\'{e}nyi mutual information. Furthermore, we apply a local decoherence to the critical ground state of the TFIM and numerically observe the R\\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information by changing the parameter controlling environment effect (corresponding to the strength of measurement) in the R\\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information and the strength of the decoherence to which the entire system subjects.

    "summary": "False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) plays a central role in cosmology and particle physics but has remained intractable for classical simulation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We present a novel method for Hamiltonian simulation of false-vacuum decay in a self-interacting scalar QFT, based on a spatial discretisation into a lattice of bosonic modes. Each mode has a continuous or quasi-continuous local Hilbert space whose dimension is large enough to capture the self-interactions in the Hamiltonian. We refer to these local modes generically as ``qumodes'', echoing the ideal case in which the lattice would be realised on a continuous-variable quantum computer. Here we show that the same framework can be implemented on a tensor network, in which case the qumodes are quasi-continuous, corresponding to the local sites of the network having a very high dimensional Hilbert space. Using a time-evolving block decimation algorithm with Trotterised time evolution, we capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. In (1+1)-dimensions, we initialise a metastable vacuum and observe the coherent entanglement growth that seeds true-vacuum bubble nucleation. Our approach establishes the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and paves the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.",

    "summary": "Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data, such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "summary": "LiNiO2 is a promising cathode material for Li-ion battery but its atomic and electronic structure is under debate. Indeed, two sets of Ni-O distances are identified from local structural probes that are related with either Jahn-Teller distortion or bond disproportionation of NiO6 octahedra. Moreover, LiNiO2 undergoes a monoclinic to rhombohedral transition at 200 K which origin is still unclear. On the other hand, isostructural NaNiO2 shows differences from LiNiO2, as it is a well-known Jahn-Teller distorted system, and it undergoes monoclinic to rhombohedral transition at 500 K associated to the loss of the Jahn-Teller distortion. To understand better these differences, we report here Ni L3-edge Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments on LiNiO2 and NaNiO2 at different temperatures (25 to 520 K) and follow the spectral changes below and above the phase transition temperatures. The observed RIXS spectra and the mapping indicate strong spectral changes for NaNiO2 confirming the disappearance of Jahn-Teller distortion during phase transition while the changes are minor for LiNiO2 suggesting very few modifications in the local structure. Theoretical simulations of RIXS spectra are required for further understanding, however, we believe that the reported dataset can be a crucial resource for developing advanced simulations that are essential to deepening our understanding of the atomic and electronic structure of these nickelates.",

Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized within their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization mechanism in many-body systems.",

In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol. By analyzing the scaling of both a novel order parameter and the entanglement entropy, our approach allows us to accurately determine the roughening transition, even at finite gauge-matter coupling.",

As part of the Munich Quantum Valley (MQV) ecosystem, the course fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between technical and business students, equipping them with the skills necessary to contribute to or lead in the emerging quantum industry. The QEL curriculum integrates two complementary tracks. First, technical students form teams where they engage in cutting-edge, industry-relevant research topics under academic supervision. Meanwhile business students in a parallel course explore commercialization strategies, risks, and opportunities within the quantum technology landscape. Midway through the semester, a selection of the business students join the technical course to form interdisciplinary teams which assess the feasibility of transforming scientific concepts into viable business solutions. The course culminates in three key deliverables: a publication-style technical report, a white paper analyzing the business potential and financial requirements, and a startup pitch presented to the quantum community at a Demo Day. This work outlines the course structure, objectives, and outcomes, providing a model for other institutions seeking to cultivate a highly skilled, innovation-driven workforce in quantum science and technology.",

However, current 2D material databases are constrained by limited scale and compositional diversity. In this study, we introduce a scalable active learning workflow that integrates deep neural networks with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to efficiently explore a vast set of candidate structures. These structures are generated through physics-informed elemental substitution strategies, enabling broad and systematic discovery of stable 2D materials. Through six iterative screening cycles, we established the creation of the Monolayer 2D Materials Database (ML2DDB), which contains 242,546 DFT-validated stable structures-an order-of-magnitude increase over the largest known 2D materials databases. In particular, the number of ternary and quaternary compounds showed the most significant increase. Combining this database with a generative diffusion model, we demonstrated effective structure generation under specified chemistry and symmetry constraints. This work accomplished an organically interconnected loop of 2D material data expansion and application, which provides a new paradigm for the discovery of new materials.",

    "summary": "Spin ice systems represent a prime example of constrained spin systems and exhibit rich low-energy physics. In this study, we explore how introducing a tunable anisotropic spin coupling to the conventional Ising spin ice Hamiltonian on the breathing pyrochlore lattice affects the ground state properties of the system. Significant changes are observed in the ground state structure, reflected in the spin structure factor and in a reduction of residual entropy at low temperatures. We theoretically uncover a rich phase diagram by varying the anisotropy and demonstrate how this modification reduces the ground state degeneracy across different phases. Numerical simulations reveal that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the system either undergoes a crossover into a constrained spin ice manifold, characterized by an entropy density that drops below the Pauling entropy of conventional spin ice, or a phase transition into a symmetry-broken state, depending on the perturbations. Additionally, we compute the spin structure factors for the anisotropic model and compare these results to analytical predictions from a large-$N$ expansion, finding good agreement. This work develops the understanding of spin ice in anisotropic limits, which may be experimentally realized by strain, providing, among others, key signatures in entropy and specific heat.",

    "summary": "Accurate grain orientation mapping is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of polycrystalline materials, particularly in energy-related applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its electrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated, using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural characterization.",

    "summary": "The nuclear quantum effects of hydrogen play a significant role in determining the phase stability of water ice. Hydrogen-bond symmetrization occurs as hydrogen atoms tunnel in a double-well potential, ultimately occupying the midpoint between oxygen atoms and transforming ice VIII into ice X under high pressure. Quantum fluctuations lower this transition from classical predictions of over 100 GPa to 60 GPa. We reveal that the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional underestimates the hydrogen double-well barrier, thus resulting in a transition pressure over 10 GPa lower than the strongly constrained and appropriately normed functional, which is validated against quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Nuclear quantum anharmonicity, treated via neural canonical transformation (NCT), reveals that this transition pressure is temperature-independent and observes a 2 GPa reduction when comparing the non-Gaussian flow models based wavefunction compared to the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Despite increasing pressure typically shortens chemical bonds and hardens phonon modes, NCT calculations reveal that hydrogen bond softens hydrogen-oxygen stretching in ice VIII upon pressure.",

    "summary": "Accurately predicting magnetic behavior across diverse materials systems remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex interplay of structural and electronic factors and is pivotal for the accelerated discovery and design of next-generation magnetic materials. In this work, a refined descriptor is proposed that significantly improves the prediction of two critical magnetic properties -- magnetic ordering (Ferromagnetic vs. Ferrimagnetic) and magnetic moment per atom -- using only the structural information of materials. Unlike previous models limited to Mn-based or lanthanide-transition metal compounds, the present approach generalizes across a diverse dataset of 5741 stable, binary and ternary, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds sourced from the Materials Project. Leveraging an enriched elemental vector representation and advanced feature engineering, including nonlinear terms and reduced matrix sparsity, the LightGBM-based model achieves an accuracy of 82.4% for magnetic ordering classification and balanced recall across FM and FiM classes, addressing a key limitation in prior studies. The model predicts magnetic moment per atom with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, surpassing the Hund's matrix and orbital field matrix descriptors. Additionally, it accurately estimates formation energy per atom, enabling assessment of both magnetic behavior and material stability. This generalized and computationally efficient framework offers a robust tool for high-throughput screening of magnetic materials with tailored properties.",

    "summary": "The physics of strongly correlated fermions described by Hubbard or $t$-$J$ models in the underdoped regime -- relevant for high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate compounds -- remains a subject of ongoing debate. In particular, the nature of charge carriers in this regime is poorly understood, in part due to the unusual properties of their spectral function. In this Letter, we present unbiased numerical results for the one-hole spectral function in a $t$-$J$ model at finite temperatures. Our study provides valuable insights into the underlying physics of magnetic (or spin-) polaron formation in a doped antiferromagnet (AFM). For example, we find how the suppression of spectral weight outside the magnetic Brillouin zone -- a precursor of Fermi arc formation -- disappears with increasing temperature, revealing nearly-deconfined spinon excitations of the undoped AFM. The pristine setting we consider can be directly explored using quantum simulators. Our calculations demonstrate that coherent quasiparticle peaks associated with magnetic polarons can be observed up to temperatures $T>J$ above the spin-exchange $J$, routinely obtained in such experiments. This paves the way for future studies of the fate of magnetic polarons in the pseudogap phase.",

    "summary": "Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.",

    "summary": "Altermagnetism (AM), the recently discovered third class of collinear magnetic order, is characterized by non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin-split electronic structure with compensated zero net magnetization. It can arise from the conventional antiferromagnetism by introducing local anisotropy on the two opposite-spin sublattices, either through structural changes in local crystallographic symmetry or spontaneous emergence of local staggered orbital order from electron correlations in multi-orbital systems. Here, we demonstrate on the two-dimensional square lattice that a $d$-wave AM can emerge spontaneously in the single-orbital extended Hubbard model, without invoking the spin-orbital coupling and multi-orbital physics. We carry out mean-field studies on the concrete single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V$ model with $U$ and $V$ the onsite and nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, obtaining the ground states, analyzing their properties, and determining the phase diagram in the $U$-$V$ plane. The $d$-wave AM with novel spin-transport behavior is found to be stabilized in a wide region of the phase diagram when the system is doped away from half-filling, actualized by the coexistence of onsite antiferromagnetic order and complex $d$-wave nearest-neighbor spin bond orders. Our findings provide an alternative route to achieve AM and substantially expand the range of candidate AM materials.",

Using quantum field theory within the Keldysh formalism to directly access the self-energy and dynamical susceptibilities in real frequencies, as detailed in our recent publication (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.115128), the primary computational challenge is the full three-dimensional real-frequency dependence of the four-point vertex. Our codebase provides a fully MPI+OpenMP parallelized implementation of the functional renormalization group (fRG) and the self-consistent parquet equations within the parquet approximation. It leverages vectorization to handle the additional complexity imposed by the Keldysh formalism, using optimized data structures and highly performant integration routines. Going beyond the results shown in the previous publication, the code includes functionality to perform fRG calculations in the multiloop framework, at arbitrary loop order, including self-consistent self-energy iterations. Moreover, implementations of various regulators, such as hybridization, interaction, frequency, and temperature are supplied.",

    "summary": "Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.",

    "summary": "Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.",

    "summary": "Quantum machine learning (QML) is an emerging field that investigates the capabilities of quantum computers for learning tasks. While QML models can theoretically offer advantages such as exponential speed-ups, challenges in data loading and the ability to scale to relevant problem sizes have prevented demonstrations of such advantages on practical problems. In particular, the encoding of arbitrary classical data into quantum states usually comes at a high computational cost, either in terms of qubits or gate count. However, real-world data typically exhibits some inherent structure (such as image data) which can be leveraged to load them with a much smaller cost on a quantum computer. This work further develops an efficient algorithm for finding low-depth quantum circuits to load classical image data as quantum states. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conduct systematic studies on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Imagenette datasets. The corresponding circuits for loading the full large-scale datasets are available publicly as PennyLane datasets and can be used by the community for their own benchmarks. We further analyze the performance of various quantum classifiers, such as quantum kernel methods, parameterized quantum circuits, and tensor-network classifiers, and we compare them to convolutional neural networks. In particular, we focus on the performance of the quantum classifiers as we introduce nonlinear functions of the input state, e.g., by letting the circuit parameters depend on the input state.",

    "summary": "Materials with tailored quantum properties can be engineered from atomic scale assembly techniques, but existing methods often lack the agility and accuracy to precisely and intelligently control the manufacturing process. Here we demonstrate a fully autonomous approach for fabricating atomic-level defects using electron beams in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that combines advanced machine learning and automated beam control. As a proof of concept, we achieved controlled fabrication of MoS-nanowire (MoS-NW) edge structures by iterative and targeted exposure of $MoS_2$ monolayer to a focused electron beam to selectively eject sulfur atoms, utilizing high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging for feedback-controlled monitoring structural evolution of defects. A machine learning framework combining a random forest model and convolutional neural networks (CNN) was developed to decode the HAADF image and accurately identify atomic positions and species. This atomic-level information was then integrated into an autonomous decision-making platform, which applied predefined fabrication strategies to instruct beam control about atomic sites to be ejected. The selected sites were subsequently exposed to localized electron beam using an FPGA-controlled scan routine with precise control over beam positioning and duration. While the MoS-NW edge structures produced exhibit promising mechanical and electronic properties, the proposed autonomous fabrication framework is material-agnostic and can be extended to other 2D materials for the creation of diverse defect structures and heterostructures beyond $MoS_2$.",

We show that the Hilbert space is comprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary phase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical values. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the ground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the `Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space changes, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization techniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the ground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each eigenstate.",

    "summary": "The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.",

In this work, we present a novel integrated computational approach that combines machine-learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations with first-principles vibrational spectroscopy calculations to reveal how graphene oxidation alters interfacial water structure. Our simulations demonstrate that pristine graphene leaves the hydrogen-bond network of interfacial water largely unperturbed, whereas graphene oxide (GO) with surface hydroxyls induces a pronounced $\\Delta f \\sim 100 cm^{-1}$ redshift of the free-OH vibrational band and a dramatic reduction in its amplitude. These spectral shifts in the computed surface-specific sum-frequency generation spectrum serve as sensitive molecular markers of the GO oxidation level, reconciling previously conflicting experimental observations. By providing a quantitative spectroscopic fingerprint of GO oxidation, our findings have broad implications for catalysis and electrochemistry, where the structuring of interfacial water is critical to performance.",

    "summary": "We present the first application of quantics tensor trains (QTTs) and tensor cross interpolation (TCI) to the solution of a full set of self-consistent equations for multivariate functions, the so-called parquet equations. We show that the steps needed to evaluate the equations (Bethe--Salpeter equations, parquet equation and Schwinger--Dyson equation) can be decomposed into basic operations on the QTT-TCI (QTCI) compressed objects. The repeated application of these operations does not lead to a loss of accuracy beyond a specified tolerance and the iterative scheme converges even for numerically demanding parameters. As examples we take the Hubbard model in the atomic limit and the single impurity Anderson model, where the basic objects in parquet equations, the two-particle vertices, depend on three frequencies, but not on momenta. The results show that this approach is able to overcome major computational bottlenecks of standard numerical methods. The applied methods allow for an exponential increase of the number of grid points included in the calculations leading to an exponentially improving computational error for a linear increase in computational cost.",

    "summary": "Due to significant progress in quantum gas microscopy in recent years, there is a rapidly growing interest in real-space properties of single mobile dopands created in correlated antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulators. However, a detailed numerical description remains challenging, even for simple toy models. As a consequence, previous numerical simulations for large systems were largely limited to $T=0$. To provide guidance for cold-atom experiments, numerical calculations at finite temperature are required. Here, we numerically study the real-time properties of a single mobile hole in the 2D $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature and draw a comparison to features observed at $T=0$. We find that a three-stage process of hole motion, which was reported at $T=0$, is valid even at finite temperature. However, already at low temperatures, the average hole velocity at long times is not simply proportional to the spin coupling, contrary to the $T=0$ behavior. Comparing our finite-temperature numerical results with the experimental data from quantum gas microscopy we find a qualitative disagreement: in experiment, hole spreading speeds up with increasing $J/t$, while in our numerics it slows down. The latter is consistent with the numerical findings previously reported at $T=0$.",

    "summary": "The utility of near-term quantum computers for simulating realistic quantum systems hinges on the stability of digital quantum matter--realized when discrete quantum gates approximate continuous time evolution--and whether it can be maintained at system sizes and time scales inaccessible to classical simulations. Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.",

    "summary": "The transport across a Kondo-correlated quantum dot coupled to two leads with independent temperatures and chemical potentials is studied using a controlled non-perturbative, and in this sense exact numeric treatment based on a hybrid numerical renormalization group combined with time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (NRG-tDMRG). We find a peak in the conductance at finite voltage bias vs. the temperature gradient $\\Delta T = T_R - T_L$ across left and right lead. We then focus predominantly on zero voltage bias but finite $\\Delta T$ far beyond linear response. We reveal the dependence of the characteristic zero-bias conductance on the individual lead temperatures. We find that the finite-$\\Delta T$ data behaves quantitatively similar to linear response with an effective equilibrium temperature derived from the different lead temperatures. The regime of sign changes in the Seebeck coefficient, signaling the presence of Kondo correlations, and its dependence on the individual lead temperatures provide a complete picture of the Kondo regime in the presence of finite temperature gradients. The results from the zero-bias conductance and Seebeck coefficient studies unveil an approximate `Kondo circle' in the $T_L/T_R$ plane as the regime within which the Kondo correlations dominate. We also study the heat current and the corresponding heat conductance vs. finite $\\Delta T$. We provide a polynomial fit for our numerical results for the thermocurrent as a function of the individual lead temperatures which may be used to fit experimental data in the Kondo regime.",

We appreciate their suggestion to consider randomized SVD and address their constructive critique on the variational properties of CBE-DMRG. However, we strongly disagree with their proposal to omit the projection to the 2-site tangent space and explain its importance for efficient bond expansion. In particular, in the context of CBE applied to the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), we show that omitting this projection can lead to avoidable errors. Lastly, we emphasize the complementary roles of 3S mixing and CBE, reiterating our recommendation from Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023) to combine both methods (CBE+$\\alpha$). We provide examples to demonstrate the superior efficiency and robustness of CBE+$\\alpha$.",

    "summary": "Higher-from symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transitions characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-from symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.",

Notably, the reduced density matrix exhibits long-range or quasi-long-range order along the replica direction, revealing a universal entanglement feature in SPT phases. As a colloary, we generalized the framework of twisted R\\'enyi-N correlator to thermal states and open quantum systems, providing an alternative formulation of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, applicable to both closed and open systems.

    "summary": "Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a distinct and fundamental class of magnetic order. Exploring its interplay with quantum phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, density-wave instabilities, and many-body effects represents a compelling frontier. In this work, we theoretically confirm the presence of high-temperature metallic altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O. We demonstrate that the anomalous metal-insulator-metal transition arises from a Lifshitz transition associated with Fermi surface reconstruction. The previously reported spin-density wave gap is found to lie below the Fermi level in our study and is now recognized to be attributed to the V-shaped density of states, originating from orbital-selective and sublattice-resolved half-metal-like behavior on a specific V atom. Furthermore, we identify the instability from the nesting of spin-momentum-locked two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, which induces the SDW state. These findings position KV$_2$Se$_2$O as a promising platform for investigating the interplay among altermagnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and density-wave order.",

    "summary": "Charge ordering induced by strong short-range repulsion in itinerant fermion systems typically follows a two-sites alternation pattern. However, the covariance matrix spectrum of the one-dimensional, half-filled, spinless $t$-$V$ model reveals a post-Hartree-Fock picture at strong repulsion, with emergent four-site disruptions of the underlying staggered mean-field state. These disruptions are captured in a thermodynamically extensive manner by a compact four-fermion Coupled Cluster (doubles) state (CCS). Remarkably, all properties of this state may be computed analytically by combinatorial means, and also derived from an exactly solvable correlated hopping Hamiltonian. Furthermore, this Coupled Cluster state can be re-expressed as a low-rank Matrix Product State (MPS) with bond dimension exactly four. In addition, we unveil a hidden connection between this Coupled Cluster ansatz and a Rokhsar-Kivelson state (RKS), which is the ground state of a solvable parent quantum tetramer model. The broad picture that we uncover here thus provides deep connections between several core concepts of correlated fermions and quantum chemistry that have previously enjoyed limited synergy. In contrast to a recent perturbative treatment on top of Hartree-Fock theory, our approach asymptotically captures the correct correlations in the $t$-$V$ model at small $t/V$, and remains a qualitatively accurate approximation even outside the perturbative regime. Our results make the case for further studies of the covariance matrix for correlated electron systems in which ground states have non-trivial unit-cell structure.",

The synthesis of diamond materials with specific characteristics and the precise control of the hosted color centers is thus essential to meet the demands of advanced applications. Yet, challenges remain in improving the concentration, uniform distribution and quality of these centers. Here we perform a review and meta-analysis of some of the main diamond synthesis methods and their parameters for the synthesis of N-, Si-, Ge- and Sn-vacancy color-centers, including worldwide trends in fabrication techniques and processes. We extract quantitative data from over 60 experimental papers and organize it in a large database (170 data sets and 1692 entries). We then use the database to train two machine learning algorithms to make robust predictions about the fabrication of diamond materials with specific properties from careful combinations of synthesis parameters. We use traditional statistical indicators to benchmark the performance of the algorithms and show that they are powerful and resource-efficient tools for researchers and material scientists working with diamond color centers and their applications.",

    "summary": "The Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its generalisations to dissipative and dipolar gases have been very useful in describing dynamics of cold atomic gases, as well as polaritons and other nonlinear systems. For some of these applications the numerically accessible grid spacing can become a limiting factor, especially in describing turbulent dynamics and short-range effects of dipole-dipole interactions. We explore the application of tensor networks to these systems, where (in analogy to related work in fluid and plasma dynamics), they allow for physically motivated data compression that makes simulations possible on large spatial grids which would be unfeasible with direct numerical simulations. Analysing different non-equilibrium cases involving vortex formation, we find that these methods are particularly efficient, especially in combination with a matrix product operator representation of the quantum Fourier transform, which enables a spectral approach to calculation of both equilibrium states and time-dependent dynamics. The efficiency of these methods has interesting physical implications for the structure in the states that are generated by these dynamics, and provides a path to describe cold gas experiments that are challenging for existing methods.",

A key requirement for these pursuits is achieving control over local crystallographic and magnetic structure, usually through sample morphology (such as synthesis of bulk crystals versus thin-films) and application of magnetic or electric fields. Here we show that V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ can be crystallized in two ordered superlattices, distinguished by the periodicity of out-of-plane magnetic intercalants. Whereas one of these structures is metallic and displays the hallmarks of altermagnetism, the other superlattice, which has not been isolated before in this family of intercalation compounds, is a semimetallic noncollinear antiferromagnet that may enable access to topologically nontrivial properties. This observation of an unconventional superlattice structure establishes a powerful route for tailoring the tremendous array of magnetic and electronic behaviors hosted in related materials.",

This emerging technique brings multi-dimensional resolution to the ultrafast dynamics of nonequilibrium phases of matter, enabling new capabilities demanding precise coherent control and measurement of many-body dynamics and multi-order correlations. By mapping complex excitations across time and frequency dimensions, THz-2DCS delivers coherence tomography of driven quantum matter, thus revealing hidden excitation pathways, measuring higher order nonlinear response functions, disentangling various quantum pathways, capturing collective modes on ultrafast timescales and at terahertz frequencies. These experimental features frequently remain obscured in traditional single particle measurements, ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, and equilibrium-based probes. This Review traces the early development of THz-2DCS and showcases significant recent progress in leveraging this technique to probe and manipulate quantum material properties, including nonequilibrium superconductivity, nonlinear magnonics, dynamical topological phases, and the detection of novel excitations and exotic collective modes with potential technological impact. Looking forward, we identify critical opportunities in advancing THz-2DCS instrumentation and experimental strategies that are shaping future applications in THz optoelectronics, quantum information processing, and sensing.",

By developing a Ginzburg--Landau theory based on microscopic models, we show that a phase-modulated Fulde--Ferrell superconducting state is stabilized via altermagnetic spin splitting, in contrast to the typical amplitude-modulated states that occur under a uniform Zeeman field. We apply our framework to different models: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. Our results indicate that the multi-sublattice structure is crucial for realizing this exotic superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring phase-modulated superconductivity without external magnetic fields.",

    "summary": "With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between two static charges in the $2+1$D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields, we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and trapped-ion quantum processors.",

Here, we predict novel real-space alternative piezomagnetic and piezoelectric responses in an emerging altermagnetic family of Lieb lattices, specifically transition-metal chalcogenides M2WS4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co). The unique S4T crystal-spin symmetry leads to distinct magnetic and electric responses depending on the direction of applied stress. When subjected to axial stress, they exhibit a giant piezomagnetic response, which is about one to two orders of magnitude larger than that of most piezomagnetic materials, while the residual C2 symmetry suppresses the piezoelectric effect. In contrast, diagonal stress induces an imbalance of oppositely aligned electric dipole moments and a significant piezoelectric response, while in-plane mirror symmetry inhibits the piezomagnetic effect. This alternative piezoresponse offers an unprecedented opportunity to precisely control electric and magnetic properties independently, opening new avenues for altermagnetic materials in high-fidelity multifunctional memory and sensor applications.",

In this study, we developed a high-throughput NEB computational framework integrated with the fine-tuned universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), enabling accelerated prediction of migration barriers based on transition state theory for the efficient discovery of fast-ion conductors. This framework automates the construction of initial/final states and migration paths, mitigating the inaccurate barriers prediction in pretrained potentials due to the insufficient training data on high-energy states. We employed the fine-tuned CHGNet model into NEB/MD calculations and the dual CHGNet-NEB/MD achieves a balance between computational speed and accuracy, as validated in NASICON-type Li$_{1+x}$Al$_x$Ti$_{2-x}$(PO$_4$)$_3$ (LATP) structures. Through high-throughput screening, we identified orthorhombic Pnma-group structures (LiMgPO$_4$, LiTiPO$_5$, etc.) which can serve as promising frameworks for fast ion conductors. Their aliovalent-doped variants, Li$_{0.5}$Mg$_{0.5}$Al$_{0.5}$PO$_4$ and Li$_{0.5}$TiPO$_{4.5}$F$_{0.5}$, were predicted to possess low activation energies, as well as high ionic conductivity of 0.19 mS/cm and 0.024 mS/cm, respectively.",

    "summary": "Altermagnetism is a collinear compensated magnetically-ordered phase with a d, g or i-wave anisotropy and alternating spin polarization of the electronic structure in the position and momentum space. Its recent discovery was in part motivated by the research of compensated magnets towards highly scalable spintronic technologies. Simultaneously, altermagnetism shares the anisotropic higher-partial-wave nature of ordering with unconventional superfluid phases which have been at the forefront of research for the past several decades. These examples illustrate the interest in altermagnetism from a broad range of science and technology perspectives. After summarizing the diverse research context, we turn the focus of this review to the symmetry, microscopy and spectroscopy signatures of altermagnetism. We start from the description of spontaneously broken and retained symmetries which delineate the compensated altermagnetic ordering as a distinct magnetic phase. Next we focus on microscopic signatures and ordering mechanism of the altermagnetic phase. We highlight crystal-structure realizations of a characteristic ferroic order of anisotropic higher-partial-wave components of atomic-scale spin densities in altermagnets, ranging from weakly-interacting metals to strongly correlated insulators. The symmetry and microscopy signatures of altermagnetism are directly reflected in spin-dependent electronic spectra and responses. We review salient band-structure features originating from the altermagnetic ordering, and from its interplay with spin-orbit coupling and topological phenomena. Throughout the review we compare altermagnetism to traditional ferromagnetism and Neel antiferromagntism, and to the currently intensely explored magnetic phases with non-collinear symmetry-protected compensated spin orders. We accompany the theoretical discussions by references to relevant experiments.",

    "summary": "The recent proposal of altermagnetism has drawn widespread attention to antiferromagnet (AFM) exhibiting spin splitting, extending beyond the realm of sign-alternating spin splitting in momentum space protected solely by rotational symmetry. Herrin, we propose a shear-strain strategy that enables significant modulation of d-wave altermagnets into an non-alter compensated magnets. A comprehensive analysis combining the magnetic moment compensation characteristics of opposite spin sublattices with the distribution of spin-resolved conduction channels in momentum space under the [001] crystal orientation reveals that shear strain breaks the rotational symmetry of alternatmagnets. To explore the application potential of non-alter compensated magnets, we designe RuO2/TiO2/RuO2 magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) with three crystallographic orientations ((001), (110), (100)) and investigated their transport properties under shear strain. This non-alter electronic structure not only enhances the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in spin-split paths of intrinsic RuO2 (226% to 431%) but also enables substantial TMR in spin-degenerate paths (from 0-88%)). Our work provides guidelines for broadening magnetic materials and device platforms.",

The Hall-on-Toric phases appear in the vicinity of the transitions between deconfined $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ phases with different background charge per unit cell, in a fixed non-trivial flux background. We confirm their existence through extensive infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations, analyzing the topological entanglement entropy, entanglement spectra, and a generalized Hall conductance. Remarkably, the Hall-on-Toric states remain robust even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry. Our findings reinforce the foundational interpretation of star and plaquette defects as magnetic and electric excitations, and reveal that this perspective extends to a much deeper level.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.",

We address this question by identifying statistical correlations among sets of minimally four eigenstates that provide a unified framework for various measures of information scrambling. These include operator mutual information and operator entanglement entropy of the time-evolution operator, as well as more conventional diagnostics such as two-point dynamical correlations and out-of-time-ordered correlators. We demonstrate this framework by deriving exact results for eigenstate correlations in a minimal model of quantum chaos -- Floquet dual-unitary circuits. These results reveal not only the butterfly effect and the information lightcone, but also finer structures of scrambling within the lightcone. Our work thus shows how the eigenstates of a chaotic system can encode the full spatiotemporal anatomy of quantum chaos, going beyond the descriptions offered by random matrix theory and the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis.",

However, this contradicts recent exact results that at very low temperature charge transport rather is normal diffusive.

    "summary": "Spintronic devices typically employ heterostructures with ferromagnets which break time-reversal symmetry and have non-vanishing magnetization. With the growing class of materials that support spin-polarized carriers, current, and excitations,it is possible to envision emerging spintronic applications that are not limited to magnetoresistance. Here we focus on chiral perovskites with no net magnetization where the space-inversion and mirror symmetries are broken to induce chiral structure. The known importance of these perovskites is further expanded by the demonstration of the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). However, the generation of the spin-polarized carriers across the interface with these chiral perovskites remains to be fully understood. Our first-principles studies for two-dimensional PbBr$_4$-based chiral perovskites provide their electronic structure and an orbital-based symmetry analysis, which allows us to establish an effective Hamiltonian to elucidate the underlying origin of their chirality. We also use this analysis for the Edelstein effect, responsible for electrical generation of the nonequilibrium spin polarization in many materials, which in chiral perovskites could be a mechanism contributing to CISS. Furthermore, by examining optical properties of chiral perovskites and the opportunity to use them to realize tunable altermagnets, another class of zero-magnetization spintronic materials, we put forth a versatile materials platform for unconventional spintronics.",

    "summary": "The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\\lesssim 2\\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.",

    "summary": "Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.",

We conducted four independent runs, both with and without pressure-transmitting media. Up to 30 GPa, we observed no significant influence of the pressure medium on the pressure dependence of the $Ge-O$ bond length ($<R_{Ge-O}>$). Between 10 and 30 GPa, the evolution of $<R_{Ge-O}>$ shows substantial variability across our experiments and previous works. The measured values lie close to those reported for crystalline polymorphs, including the rutile- and $CaCl_{2}$-type phase of $GeO_{2}$. This finding suggests that the amorphous structure possesses considerable flexibility to transition among different atomic configurations. From 30 GPa to 158 GPa, our results for both $<R_{Ge-O}>$ and the non-bonded cation-cation distance $<R_{Ge...Ge}>$ demonstrate that edge-sharing octahedra remain the main structural motives in glassy $GeO_{2}$. Up to 100 GPa, compaction proceeds primarily via distortions of octahedral $O-Ge-O$ bond angles accompanied by octahedral bond shortening. Above 100 GPa, octahedral distortion becomes the prevailing mechanism. Compared to its crystalline analogues ($\\alpha-PbO_{2}$ and pyrite-like phase), glassy $GeO_{2}$ exhibits a slightly less efficient compaction mechanism, likely due to kinetic constraints that inhibit reconstructive lattice rearrangements.",

    "summary": "In soft matter science, it is often the goal to design new materials with targeted properties. These materials can be used in many applications, each requiring specific features to be optimized for maximum fitness. The use of self-assembly processes, where a target structure is attained from suitably designed building blocks, is a powerful tool for this optimization. However, it is still an open question how to generally design realizable building blocks that lead to the desired phases. In this work, the double gyroid is chosen as target structure and DNA functionalized nanoparticles are used as our building blocks. Using existing pair potentials as inspiration, a large design space is defined for exploration of the target structure. An effective search strategy is implemented, where free energy calculations are first used to coarse grain our originally fine-grained model of the building blocks and then quickly evaluate the fitness of each design. These data are then fed into a machine learning algorithm that allows obtaining predictions for all candidates in our design space through an active learning loop. Successful coarse-grained designs are identified and evaluated again through interfacial pinning calculations with the fine-grained model. This work leads to the development of specific, experimentally relevant designs of DNA functionalized nanoparticles that self-assembly into the target phase. The methodology used can be extended to other types of building blocks and target structures.",

    "summary": "Despite exhibiting a similar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band character to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates host additional electron pockets that distinguish them from single-band cuprates. The elusive orbital origin of these electron pockets has led to competing theoretical scenarios. Here, using polarization-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we determine the orbital character of the Fermi surfaces in NdNiO$_2$. Our data reveal that the electron-like pocket arises predominantly from interstitial $s$ states, with negligible contributions from rare-earth 5$d$ and 4$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level. The observation of well-defined quantum well states indicates a uniform distribution of these interstitial electrons throughout the film thickness. By comparing with electronic structure of LaNiO$_2$, we find that the rare-earth element modulates the Ni-derived bands and hopping integrals through a chemical pressure effect. These findings clarify the role of rare-earth elements in shaping the low-energy electronic structure and establish the presence of electride-like interstitial $s$ states in a correlated oxide system, where electrons occupy lattice voids rather than atomic orbitals. The electride-like character offer new insight into the self-doping and superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.",

The magnetic and charge configurations in the normal phase of multilayer nickelates which closely relate to the spin-charge fluctuations remain under strongly debated. In this work, we focus the normal-state magnetic, charge and orbital configurations and its evolutions with hydrostatic pressure and Sr-doping concentration of monolayer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$. We reveal that in the ambient pressure tetragonal La2NiO4 displays Neel-type antiferromagnetic order in planer Ni spins with negligible interlayer magnetic coupling; with the increase of pressure, La2NiO4 evolves from insulate into metallic state with the critical pressure about P = 50 GPa; with the substitution of La by Sr, the magnetic ground state evolves from G-type, A-type, to double spin striped antiferromagnetic states, as well as weak charge and orbital orders, at x=1; These results can greatly promote our understanding of the magnetic properties of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, and shed the light of the pairing mechanism of unconventional nickelate superconductors.",

    "summary": "We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g., mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional (2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500 devices, a factor >40$\\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently, fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models, including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination ($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets online.",

    "summary": "In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an \"entangler\" and a \"disentangler\", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.",

In particular, advances of experimental techniques such as cold-atoms measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Fermi-Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction and temperature of the system is changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atoms experiments. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign. Moreover, our specific heat results demonstrate interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime.",

    "summary": "Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this, we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.",

    "summary": "Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has been in the focus of contemporary condensed matter research as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism. In the face of daunting evidence for bulk magnetic order despite promising theoretical predictions, it naturally suggests the focus on thin films where Coulomb interactions are dimensionally quenched and may yield a more strongly correlated environment prone to magnetic ordering. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT), and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to investigate atomically ordered ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) grown on Ru(0001). Contrary to predictions of magnetic order, we observe a nonmagnetic charge density wave (CDW) instability that is driven by Fermi surface nesting within the flat-band surface state, and stabilized by the incommensurate moir\\'e stacking with the substrate. We further identify a nonmagnetic and metastable 2 $\\times$ 2 surface reconstruction that breaks in-plane mirror symmetry and can be reversibly toggled via STM tip manipulation. Our spin-polarized STM measurements find no sign of any magnetic instability at the RuO$_2$ surface. As much as our findings refute proposals for either bulk or surface magnetism in RuO$_2$, we establish ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) as an intriguing platform for exploring Moir\\'e-assisted electronic surface order.",

However, the nature of the various CSC mechanisms and their correlation with underlying crystal symmetries remain unsettled. In this work, we use local spin-sensitive electrochemical potential measurements to directly probe the spatially dependent nonequilibrium spin accumulation in MoTe$_2$ flakes down to four atomic layers. We are able to clearly disentangle contributions originating from the spin Hall and Rashba-Edelstein effects and uncover an abundance of unconventional spin polarizations that develop uniquely in the sample bulk and edges with decreasing thickness. Using ab-initio calculations, we construct a unified understanding of all the observed CSC components in relation to the material dimensionality and stacking arrangement. Our findings not only illuminate previous CSC results on MoTe$_2$ but also have important ramifications for future devices that can exploit the local and layer-dependent spin properties of this 2D topological material.",

In contrast, Green's function-based methods are widely used to compute ionization potentials and electron affinities but have seen limited application to resonances. We integrate the CAP formalism within the $GW$ approximation, enabling the description of electronic resonances in a Green's function framework. This approach entails a fully complex treatment of orbitals and quasiparticle energies in a non-Hermitian setting. We validate our CAP-$GW$ implementation by applying it to the prototypical shape resonances of \\ce{N2^-}, \\ce{CO^-}, \\ce{CO_2^-}, \\ce{C2H2-}, \\ce{C2H4-}, and \\ce{CH2O-}. It offers a fast and practical route to approximate both the lifetimes and positions of resonance states, achieving an accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art wavefunction-based methods.",

    "summary": "The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\\sqrt{3}$$\\times$$\\sqrt{3}$)R30{\\deg} and (2$\\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.",

Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG (hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.",

By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.",

    "summary": "The development of materials science is undergoing a shift from empirical approaches to data-driven and algorithm-oriented research paradigm. The state-of-the-art platforms are confined to inorganic crystals, with limited chemical space, sparse experimental data and a lack of integrated online computation for rapid validation. Here, we introduce the Clean Energy Materials Platform (CEMP), an open-access platform that integrates high-throughput computing workflows, multi-scale machine learning (ML) models and a comprehensive materials database tailored for clean energy applications. A key feature of CEMP is the online calculation module, which enables fully automatic quantum and molecular dynamics simulations via structured table uploads. CEMP harmonizes heterogeneous data from experimental measurements, theoretical calculation and AI-based predictions for four material classes, including small molecules, polymers, ionic liquids, and crystals. The platform hosts ~ 376,000 entries, including ~6,000 experimental records, ~50,000 quantum-chemical calculations and ~320,000 AI-predicted properties. The database covers 12 critical properties and the corresponding ML models demonstrate robust predictive power with R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.94, thus ensures rapid material screening, structure-property relationship analysis and multi-objective optimization for clean energy applications. CEMP aims to establish a digital ecosystem for clean energy materials, enabling a closed-loop workflow from data acquisition to material discovery and real-time online validation.",

    "summary": "Using the developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling behaviors of the normalized spin current across the interface. Using the 1D Heisenberg chain as a benchmark system, we observe a negative spinon spin current exhibiting algebraic scaling $T^{\\alpha}$, with exponent $\\alpha$, in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence - distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase. It saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit, and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive probes for spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Furthermore, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.",

    "summary": "We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$, formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site, along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and $U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral function exhibits \"Fermi arcs\", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field, aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al. (arXiv:2411.10631).",

In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.",

    "summary": "Understanding and predicting the glassy dynamics of polymers remain fundamental challenges in soft matter physics. While the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory has been successful in describing relaxation dynamics, its practical application to polymers depends on a thermal mapping to connect theory with experiment, which in turn requires detailed thermodynamic data. Such data may not be available for chemically complex or newly designed polymers. In this work, we propose a simple approach that integrates machine learning-predicted glass transition temperatures (Tg) with a simplified thermal mapping based on an effective thermal expansion coefficient to overcome these limitations. This approach can provide quantitatively accurate predictions of relaxation dynamics across a broad range of polymers. Rather than replacing the original thermal mapping, our method complements it by trading formal rigor for computational efficiency and broader applicability in high-throughput screening and materials with limited available data. Moreover, we introduce a physically motivated modification to the thermal mapping that resolves discrepancies in the description of low-Tg polymers. Our results establish a generalizable approach for predictive modeling of glassy polymer dynamics and point toward new directions for theory-guided materials discovery.",

We show that the tensor network simulations can be carried out solely using highly compressed tensor representations of the flow fields and the differential operators and discuss the numerical implementation of the tensor operations required for computing fluid flows in detail. The applicability of our method is demonstrated by applying it to the paradigm example of steady and transient flows around stationary and rotating cylinders. We find excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to finite difference simulations for Strouhal numbers, forces and velocity fields. The properties of our approach are discussed in terms of reduced order models. We estimate the memory saving and potential runtime advantages in comparison to standard finite difference simulations. We find accurate results with errors of less than 0.3% for flow-field compressions by a factor of up to 20 and differential operators compressed by factors of up to 1000 compared to sparse matrix representations. We provide strong numerical evidence that the runtime scaling advantages of the tensor network approach with system size will provide substantial resource savings when simulating larger systems. Finally, we note that, like other tensor network-based fluid flow simulations, our algorithmic framework is directly portable to a quantum computer leading to further scaling advantages.",

    "summary": "Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However, MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \\emph{Tensor Train Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank, linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.",

This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.",

    "summary": "Solving partial differential equations of highly featured problems represents a formidable challenge, where reaching high precision across multiple length scales can require a prohibitive amount of computer memory or computing time. However, the solutions to physics problems typically have structures operating on different length scales, and as a result exhibit a high degree of compressibility. Here, we use the quantics tensor train representation to build a solver for the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that the quantics approach generalizes well to the presence of the non-linear term in the equation. We show that we can resolve phenomena across length scales separated by seven orders of magnitude in one dimension within one hour on a single core in a laptop, greatly surpassing the capabilities of more naive methods. We illustrate our methodology with various modulated optical trap potentials presenting features at vastly different length scales, including solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on two-dimensional grids above a trillion points ($2^{20} \\times 2^{20}$). This quantum-inspired methodology can be readily extended to other partial differential equations combining spatial and temporal evolutions, providing a powerful method to solve highly featured differential equations at unprecedented length scales.",

By evolving the system entirely within a low-rank tensor manifold, the method sidesteps the memory and runtime barriers that limit conventional finite-difference and spectral schemes. Two complementary algorithms are developed: an imaginary-time projector that drives the condensate toward its variational ground state and a rank-adapted fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for real-time dynamics. The framework captures a broad range of physical scenarios - including barrier-confined condensates, quasi-random potentials, long-range dipolar interactions, and multicomponent spinor dynamics - without leaving the compressed representation. Relative to standard discretizations, the QTT approach achieves an exponential reduction in computational resources while retaining quantitative accuracy, thereby extending the practicable regime of Gross-Pitaevskii simulations on classical hardware. These results position tensor networks as a practical bridge between high-performance classical computing and prospective quantum hardware for the numerical treatment of nonlinear Schrodinger-type partial differential equations.",

We show that breaking time-translation symmetry down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin.

This method is based in representing a periodic micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it particularly attractive for large-scale applications.",

    "summary": "Correlated electron physics is intrinsically a multiscale problem, since high-energy electronic states screen the interactions between the correlated electrons close to the Fermi level, thereby reducing the magnitude of the interaction strength and dramatically shortening its range. Thus, the handling of screening is an essential ingredient in the first-principles modelling of correlated electron systems. Screening is an intrinsically dynamic process and the corresponding downfolding methods such as the constrained Random Phase Approximation indeed produce a dynamic interaction. However, many low-energy methods require an instantaneous interaction as input, which makes it necessary to map the fully dynamic interaction to an effective instantaneous interaction strength. It is a priori not clear if and when such an effective model can capture the physics of the one with dynamic interaction and how to best perform the mapping. Here, we provide a systematic benchmark relevant to correlated materials, in the form of the Anderson impurity model. Overall, we find that a moment-based approach recently proposed by Scott and Booth performs well. We also identify physical regimes, especially under doping, where an instantaneous interaction cannot capture all of the relevant physics.",

    "summary": "The atomic structure of the most stable reconstructed surface of cuprous oxide (Cu$_{2}$O)(111) surface has been a longstanding topic of debate. In this study, we develop on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate the various reconstructions of the Cu$_{2}$O(111) surface under stoichiometric as well as O- and Cu-deficient or rich conditions, focusing on both ($\\sqrt{3}$$\\times$$\\sqrt{3}$)R30{\\deg} and (2$\\times$2) supercells. By utilizing parallel tempering simulations supported by MLFFs, we confirm that the previously described nanopyramidal and Cu-deficient (1$\\times$1) structures are the lowest energy structures from moderately to strong oxidizing conditions. In addition, we identify two promising nanopyramidal reconstructions at highly reducing conditions, a stoichiometric and a Cu-rich one. Surface energy calculations performed using spin-polarized PBE, PBE+U, r$^{2}$SCAN, and HSE06 functionals show that the previously known Cu-deficient configuration and nanopyramidal configurations are at the convex hull (and, thus, equilibrium structures) for all functionals, whereas the stability of the other structures depends on the functional and is therefore uncertain. Our findings demonstrate that on-the-fly trained MLFFs provide a simple, efficient, and rapid approach to explore the complex surface reconstructions commonly encountered in experimental studies, and also enhance our understanding of the stability of Cu$_{2}$O(111) surfaces.",

    "summary": "The polaron problem is a very old problem in condensed matter physics that dates back to the thirties, but still remain largely unsolved today, especially when electron-electron interaction is taken into consideration. The presence of both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the problem invalidates most existing numerical methods, either computationally too expensive or simply intractable. The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the imaginary-time axis. In this work we present a method based on tensor network and the path integral formalism to solve polaron impurity problems. As both the electron and phonon baths can be integrated out via the Feynman-Vernon influence functional in the path integral formalism, our method is free of bath discretization error. It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and the L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve several long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii) measuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive numerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC. We also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done before to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future method developments.",

    "summary": "This work presents a computational framework for studying reaction dynamics via wavepacket propagation, employing the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method and its multilayer extension (ML-MCTDH) as the core methodologies. The core idea centers on the concept of modes that combine several coordinates along with their hierarchical separations because the degrees of freedom are too numerous to be efficiently treated as a single mode. First, the system is partitioned into several fragments within the same layer, and these fragments are further decomposed. Repeating this process, a hierarchical separation of modes emerges, until modes of a manageable size are achieved. Accordingly, the coordinates frame can be designed hierarchically. Second, the kinetic energy operator (KEO) is derived as a sum-of-products (SOP) of single-particle differential operators through polyspherical approach, while the potential energy surface (PES) is expressed in a similar SOP form of single-particle potentials (SPPs) through (1) reconstruction approaches using an existing PES or (2) direct approaches based on a computed database. Third, the nuclear wave function is expressed in a multi-layer expansion form, where each term is a product of single-particle functions (SPFs) that are further expanded by the SPFs in deeper layer. This expansion form is also adopted by variational eigensolver for electronic wave function. Finally, the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle leads to a set of working equations whose solutions reproduce reaction dynamics. In addition, the hierarchical framework can be rearranged by the mathematical language of tensor network (TN) or tree tensor network (TTN). In this work, we compare the methods represented by function with those in the form of TN or TTN. We also discuss the limitations of the present framework and propose solutions, providing further perspectives.",

Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.",

Using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.",

In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.",

Here, we propose a symmetry-aware, grid-free, transformer-based model, MBFormer, that is designed to learn the entire many-body hierarchy directly from mean-field inputs, exploiting the attention mechanism to accurately capture many-body correlations between mean-field states. As proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of MBFormer in predicting results based on the GW plus Bethe Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism, including quasiparticle energies, exciton energies, exciton oscillator strengths, and exciton wavefunction distribution. Our model is trained on a dataset of 721 two-dimensional materials from the C2DB database, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a low prediction mean absolute error (MAE) on the order of 0.1-0.2 eV for state-level quasiparticle and exciton energies across different materials. Moreover, we show explicitly that the attention mechanism plays a crucial role in capturing many-body correlations. Our framework provides an end-to-end platform from ground states to general many-body prediction in real materials, which could serve as a foundation model for computational materials science.",

    "summary": "Multipartite entanglement offers a powerful framework for understanding the complex collective phenomena in quantum many-body systems that are often beyond the description of conventional bipartite entanglement measures. Here, we propose a class of multipartite entanglement measures that incorporate the matrix product state (MPS) representation, enabling the characterization of the optimality of quantum circuits for state preparation. These measures are defined as the minimal distances from a target state to the manifolds of MPSs with specified virtual bond dimensions $\\chi$, and thus are dubbed as $\\chi$-specified matrix product entanglement ($\\chi$-MPE). We demonstrate superlinear, linear, and sublinear scaling behaviors of $\\chi$-MPE with respect to the negative logarithmic fidelity $F$ in state preparation, which correspond to excessive, optimal, and insufficient circuit depth $D$ for preparing $\\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs, respectively. Specifically, a linearly-growing $\\chi$-MPE with $F$ suggests $\\mathcal{H}_{\\chi} \\simeq \\mathcal{H}_{D}$, where $\\mathcal{H}_{\\chi}$ denotes the manifold of the $\\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs and $\\mathcal{H}_{D}$ denotes that of the states accessible by the $D$ layer circuits. We provide an exact proof that $\\mathcal{H}_{\\chi=2} \\equiv \\mathcal{H}_{D=1}$. Our results establish tensor networks as a powerful and general tool for developing parametrized measures of multipartite entanglement. The matrix product form adopted in $\\chi$-MPE can be readily extended to other tensor network ans\\\"atze, whose scaling behaviors are expected to assess the optimality of quantum circuit in preparing the corresponding tensor network states.",

    "summary": "Altermagnets, with spin splitting and vanishing magnetization, have been attributed to many fascinating phenomena and potential applications. In particular, integrating ferroelectricity with altermagnetism to enable magnetoelectric coupling and electric control of spin has drawn significant attention. However, its experimental realization and precise spin manipulation remain elusive. Here, by focusing on molecular ferroelectrics, the first discovered ferroelectrics renowned for their highly controllable molecular polarizations and structural flexibility, we reveal that these obstacles can be removed by an emergent multiferroic altermagnets with tunable spin polarization in a large class of fabricated organic materials. Using a symmetry-based design and a tight-binding model, we uncover the underlying mechanism of such molecular ferroelectric altermagnets and demonstrate how noncollinear molecular polarization can switch the spin polarization on and off and even reverse its sign. From the first-principles calculations, we verify the feasibility of these materials in a series of well-established hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and metal-organic frameworks. Our findings bridge molecular ferroelectrics and altermagnetic spintronics, highlighting an unexplored potential of multifunctional organic multiferroics.",

Focusing on the systems with higher hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL is beneficial to the global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the picture that the IL itself can drive the $d$-wave superconductivity while the OLs only serve as the charge reservoir. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.",

This 'reverse engineering approach' leads to $|M_q|^2 \\sim \\frac{1}{q^2+\\xi(T)^{-2}}$. We comment how can such exotic coupling emerge in 2D systems where short range magnetic fluctuations resides. In other words, the role of quantum criticality is found to be crucial. And the T-linear behaviour of resistivity demands that the magnetic correlation length scales as $\\xi(T)\\propto\\frac{1}{T}$, which seems to be a reasonable assumption in the quantum critical regime of cuprates (that is, near optimal doping where T-linear resistivity is observed).",

This computational obstacle limits the potential of the technique as it precludes the reconstruction of physically interesting highly-strained particles. Here, we propose a novel approach to this problem using a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on 3D simulated diffraction data to predict the corresponding reciprocal space phase. This method allows to fully exploit the potential of the CNN by mapping functions within the same space and leveraging structural similarities between input and output. The final object is obtained by the inverse Fourier transform of the retrieved complex diffracted amplitude and is then further refined with iterative algorithms.

Our semiclassical Monte Carlo calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials. This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we demonstrate that when the on-site repulsive Hubbard interaction strength is set to zero on a percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably, this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.",

    "summary": "The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics. It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a system responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property. Applications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To prove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry property, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of certain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS relation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation contains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size. Non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed recently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as usual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we argue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a Heisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational capacity, indirectly support the larger correction. This work helps extend into nonequilibrium physics the effort, recently of interest across quantum physics, to identify how non-Abelian symmetries may alter conventional thermodynamics.",

    "summary": "Quantum phase transitions between topologically ordered and symmetry-broken phases lie beyond Landau theory. A prime example is the conjectured continuous transition from the bosonic $\\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state to a superfluid, proposed to be governed by a QED$_3$--Chern--Simons (CS) critical point whose stability remains uncertain. We study half-filled bosons in the lowest Landau level subject to a lattice potential. Infinite-cylinder DMRG reveals a single continuous Laughlin--to--superfluid transition. Adiabatic flux insertion collapses the many-body gap and exposes massless Dirac quasiparticles, while momentum-resolved correlation lengths show that three lattice-related density modes share the same critical exponent, evidencing an emergent $SO(3)$ symmetry. The joint appearance of Dirac dispersion and symmetry enlargement provides microscopic support for a stable QED$_3$--CS fixed point. Our numerical strategy also offers a blueprint for exploring Landau-forbidden transitions in fractional Chern insulators and composite Fermi liquids realised in moire and cold-atom systems.",

    "summary": "A quantum state of matter that is forbidden to interact with photons and is therefore undetectable by spectroscopic means is called a dark state. This basic concept can be applied to condensed matter where it suggests that a whole band of quantum states could be undetectable across a full Brillouin zone. Here we report the discovery of such condensed matter dark states in palladium diselenide as a model system that has two pairs of sublattices in the primitive cell. By using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find valence bands that are practically unobservable over the whole Brillouin zone at any photon energy, polarisation, and scattering plane. Our model shows that two pairs of sublattices located at half-translation positions and related by multiple glide-mirror symmetries make their relative quantum phases polarised into only four kinds, three of which become dark due to double destructive interference. This mechanism is generic to other systems with two pairs of sublattices, and we show how the phenomena observed in cuprates, lead-halide perovskites, and density wave systems can be resolved by the mechanism of dark states. Our results suggest that the sublattice degree of freedom, which has been overlooked so far, should be considered in the study of correlated phenomena and optoelectronic characteristics.",

In one dimension, the so-called infrared divergence prevents us from calculating any -- whether static or dynamic -- structure factor within the conventional spin-wave theory even at zero temperature. The well-known modified spin-wave theory initiated by Takahashi completely fails to treat anharmonicities to cause transverse-to-longitudinal coupling which are quite characteristic of noncollinear antiferromagnets. We propose imposing a double-constraint condition on spin waves to solve all these difficulties and get a full view of the nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in one-dimensional frustrated noncollinear antiferromagnets. We reveal a novel instability of the single-particle spectrum in the absence of any well-defined magnetically ordered ground state.",

For this task, here we introduce a \\textit{tangent-space excitation ansatz} for quantum circuits, motivated by the quasi-particle picture of many-body systems and the structural similarity between quantum circuits and classical tensor networks. Increasing the circuit depth by one layer to construct the tangent space around the variational optimum of a parametrized quantum circuit, we show that a large number of low-energy states can be accurately captured. We demonstrate this ansatz using various models in both one and two spatial dimensions, including the challenging kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We further provide evidence that this approach, implementable using Hadamard test, is stable in the presence of measurement noise and scalable to large system size.",

    "summary": "We explore topological electronic structure of magnetic phases in a multi-orbital Hubbard model with spin-orbit interactions. To account for more general antiferromagnetic orders that go beyond the collinear N\\'eel order, two different spin-orbit interactions, Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit interactions, are considered. By performing the canonical transformation, we derive the corresponding generalized t-J model. At half filling, employing self-consistent magnetic order calculations, we find distinctive spin arrangements under Dresselhaus or Rashba spin-orbit interactions. For the Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, the spin configuration exhibits collinear antiferromagnetic order. On the other hand, Rashba interaction results in spins antiferromagnetically aligning in xy-plane and a small interaction controlled by hopping parameter induces spin tilting, causing antiferromagnetic alignment in xy-plane but ferromagnetic alignment in z-direction. We categorize topological properties of these phases for low doping in the generalized t-J model.: for 3D collinear antiferromagnetic order, the system possesses a modified time-reversal symmetry, characterized by the Z2 index. In contrast, for systems with tilted antiferromagnetic orders, it is protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by the Z4 index. We further examine the bulk-edge correspondence for non-collinear magnetic phases, revealing that the surface state becomes gapless when the surface is parallel to the ferromagnetic component of tilted antiferromagnetic order; otherwise, the surface state exhibits a gap. Our findings offer a comprehensive topological characterization for doped and canted antiferromagnetic insulators with spin-orbit interactions, providing valuable insights into the interplay between spin arrangements, symmetries, and topological properties in systems governed by the multi-orbital Hubbard model.",

    "summary": "We introduce an efficient approach to implement neural network quantum states (NNQS) as trial wavefunctions in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). NNQS are a recently developed class of variational ans\\\"atze capable of flexibly representing many-body wavefunctions, though they often incur a high computational cost during optimization. AFQMC, on the other hand, is a powerful stochastic projector approach for ground-state calculations, but it normally requires an approximate constraint via a trial wavefunction or trial density matrix, whose quality affects the accuracy. Recent progress has shown that a broad class of highly correlated wavefunctions can be integrated into AFQMC through stochastic sampling techniques. In this work, we present a direct integration of NNQS with AFQMC, allowing NNQS to serve as high-quality trial wavefunctions for AFQMC with manageable computational cost. We test the NNQS-AFQMC method on the challenging nitrogen molecule (N$_2$) at stretched geometries.

However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models, general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process. While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the coming years.",

    "summary": "Recent experimental study on Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ superconductors has revealed an unexpected quantum phase transition from superconducting state to insulatinglike state under pressure [Zhou et al., Nat. Phys. 18, 406 (2022)]. To better understand the physical origin of this pressure-induced phenomenon, here we have studied the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of undoped and O-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212) under pressures based on density-functional theory calculations. We first identified the crystal structure of undoped Bi2212 with the armchair distortions in the BiO layers and reproduced the insulating feature of the parent compound. Then we added an extra O atom to the parent compound to simulate the hole-doping effect and found that the structure with O dopant located in the van der Waals (vdW) gap is energetically the most stable. Further calculations on O-doped (0.125 holes/Cu) Bi2212 revealed that the pressure can induce charge redistributions between CuO$_2$ planes and BiO layers; specifically, Cu-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals gain electrons and Cu atoms rather than O atoms dominate around the Fermi level under high pressure. Along with the increasing pressure, the density of states at the Fermi level first reaches the maximum at $\\sim$ 10 GPa and then shows a valley near the Fermi level above 20 GPa, which may be responsible for the insulatinglike state observed in recent experiments. We suggest that the competition among several factors, such as the increase of electrons in the CuO$_2$ plane, the variation of in-plane hopping due to the shortened Cu-O distance, and the enhanced Coulomb repulsion among the Cu-3$d$ electrons, could lead to the exotic transition under pressure. Our work provides an explanation of the high-pressure behaviors of Bi2212, which may facilitate a comprehensive understanding of cuprate superconductors.",

    "summary": "Quantum algorithms for estimating the ground state energy of a quantum system often operate by preparing a classically accessible quantum state and then applying quantum phase estimation. Whether this approach yields quantum advantage hinges on the state's energy spectrum, that is, the sequence of the state's overlaps with the energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian. For any entanglement-compressed quantum state with minimal expected energy, it is shown that its energy spectrum decays at most with the inverse-squared energy eigenvalues. This explains the main empirical finding of Silvester, Carleo, and White (Physical Review Letters, 2025) that the energy spectra of matrix product states do not decay exponentially. It also reduces the question of quantum advantage to the energy and entanglement profile of the Hamiltonian's eigenstates.",

    "summary": "Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\\bot}$ model, where $t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and $J_{\\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the system by tuning $J_{\\bot}$ in a large doping range $\\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We find that a large $J_{\\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range, appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\\delta = 1/4$. By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\\bot}$, as reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\\bot}$ regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable, the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\\rm SC} \\sim 1$. At last, we show that the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\\bot}$ interaction, from both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.",

For spin-1/2 KAFH, our best per-site ground-state energy estimate reaches -0.417J, and after applying open-boundary corrections, it closely approaches the established thermodynamic value of -0.438J. To achieve this, we propose a hybrid approach that splits the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. We further introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining physical accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices.",

While its efficacy has been demonstrated in the homogeneous systems theoretically, most experimental setups feature a confining potential, such as a harmonic trap, which complicates the practical implementations. In this work, we experimentally probe the quench spectroscopy for one-dimensional bosons in optical lattices with the presence of a harmonic trap, and comparing our results with the density matrix renormalization group simulation. For the Mott insulator phase, although a gap is still observed, the band signal is broadened along the frequency space and cut at the half Brillouin zone, which can be explained by the excitations under harmonic confinement. Comparing with the superfluid spectrum, we can see a clear distinction between the two phases and find the inverse quench with larger amplitude yields the clearest spectrum. Our work offers pivotal insights into conducting quench spectroscopy effectively in practical systems.",

    "summary": "Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable moire potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before a metallic state forms. A chiral $f+if$ superconductor and a commensurate $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) differ in energy by less than $1\\%$, reproducing the distinct superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases experimentally observed near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome remains robust against realistic Coulomb screening, light doping, and variations in lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.",

    "summary": "A key to understand how electrons behave in crystalline solids is the band structure that connects the energy of electron waves to their wavenumber (k). Even in the phase of matter with only short-range order (liquid or amorphous solid), the coherent part of electron waves still possesses a band structure. Theoretical models for the band structure of liquid metals were formulated more than 5 decades ago, but thus far, bandstructure renormalization and pseudogap induced by resonance scattering have remained unobserved. Here, we report the observation of this unusual band structure at the interface of a crystalline insulator (black phosphorus) and disordered dopants (alkali metals). We find that a conventional parabolic band structure of free electrons bends back towards zero k with the pseudogap of 30-240 meV from the Fermi level. This is k renormalization caused by resonance scattering that leads to the formation of quasi-bound states in the scattering potential of alkali-metal ions. The depth of this potential tuned by different kinds of alkali metal (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) allows to classify the pseudogap of p-wave and d-wave resonance. Our results may provide a clue to the puzzling spectrum of various crystalline insulators doped by disordered dopants, such as the waterfall dispersion in cuprates.",

    "summary": "The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized bulk $\\mathrm{La}_{3}\\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{7}$ has ignited significant interest in nickelate superconductors. Unlike cuprates, where superconductivity predominantly originates from the $\\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, nickelates exhibit additional complexities involving contributions from the $\\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$ orbital, prompting fundamental questions about their pairing mechanisms. Despite recent progress in stabilizing superconductivity in $\\mathrm{La}_{3}\\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films at ambient pressure, direct spectroscopic evidence of the superconducting gap opening remains elusive. Here, we present an in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of Sr-doped superconducting $\\mathrm{La}_{3}\\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films. Fermi surface mapping reveals Ni-$\\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-derived $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ pockets, with orbital fillings of 0.11$\\pm$0.02 electrons and 0.66$\\pm$0.03 holes per Ni, respectively, resulting in a total of 0.45$\\pm$0.04 electrons for each Ni. These bands exhibit moderate electron correlations, characterized by a band renormalization factor of 3-4. Notably, both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ bands exhibit leading-edge shifts across the superconducting transition, with gap magnitude of ~1-2 meV at Fermi momenta along the Brillouin zone diagonal and slightly away from the zone diagonal, deviating from the conventional $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap structure. Additionally, the Ni-$\\mathrm{3}d_{z^2}$-derived $\\gamma$ band lies ~75 meV below the Fermi level, indicating a $\\mathrm{3}d_{x^2-y^2}$-dominated fermiology in this compound.",

Half-integer $\\kappa/\\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the experimentally observed value of $\\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian' state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an 'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can \"screen'' a Pfaffian or AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from those of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is consistent with experiment.",

In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.",

Integrating these simulations with the PDynA analysis toolkit, we resolve both equilibrium phase diagrams and dynamic structural evolution under varying temperature and halide-mixing conditions. Our findings reveal that the A-site cation strongly modulates octahedral tilt modes and phase pathways: MA$^+$ effectively \"forbids\" the beta-to-gamma transition in MAPbX$_3$ by requiring extensive molecular rearrangements and crystal rotation, whereas the debated low-temperature phase in FAPbX$_3$ is best represented as an Im$\\bar{3}$ cubic phase with $a^+a^+a^+$ tilts. Additionally, small changes in halide composition and arrangement $\\unicode{x2013}$ from uniform mixing to partial segregation $\\unicode{x2013}$ alter tilt correlations. Segregated domains can even foster anomalous tilting modes that impede uniform phase transformations. These results highlight the multi-scale interplay between cation environment and halide distribution, offering a rational basis for tuning perovskite architectures toward improved phase stability.",

    "summary": "The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales, making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates. Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging many-fermions systems.",

    "summary": "Abinit is a widely used scientific software package implementing density functional theory and many related functionalities for excited states and response properties. This paper presents the novel features and capabilities, both technical and scientific, which have been implemented over the past 5 years. This evolution occurred in the context of evolving hardware platforms, high-throughput calculation campaigns, and the growing use of machine learning to predict properties based on databases of first principles results. We present new methodologies for ground states with constrained charge, spin or temperature; for density functional perturbation theory extensions to flexoelectricity and polarons; and for excited states in many-body frameworks including GW, dynamical mean field theory, and coupled cluster. Technical advances have extended abinit high-performance execution to graphical processing units and intensive parallelism. Second principles methods build effective models on top of first principles results to scale up in length and time scales. Finally, workflows have been developed in different community frameworks to automate \\abinit calculations and enable users to simulate hundreds or thousands of materials in controlled and reproducible conditions.",

Here, we introduce an alternative isometric form for isoTPS by incorporating auxiliary tensors to represent the orthogonality hypersurface. We implement the time evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on this new isometric form and benchmark the method by computing ground states and the real time evolution of the transverse field Ising model in two dimensions on large square lattices of up to 1250 sites. Our results demonstrate that isoTPS can efficiently capture the entanglement structure of two-dimensional area law states. The short-time dynamics is also accurately reproduced even at the critical point. Our isoTPS formulation further allows for a natural extension to different lattice geometries, such as the honeycomb or kagome latice.",

We study the hole-doped model, identifying a transition from magnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the strong-coupling regime. Our findings offer a qualitatively new ground state picture.

For different dopings, we model slabs cut at 45$^\\circ$ relative to the main crystallographic $ab$-axes, i.e., [110] orientation, and conclude that quasiparticle charge is drawn to the edges. Thus, the correlations are locally strengthened, and a region near the edge is closer to the Mott insulating state with reduced hopping amplitudes on the links. Superconductivity is locally weakened near the edges in the correlated state, and the spectral weight of zero-energy Andreev bound states is substantially reduced compared to weak coupling theory. The renormalization of the edge states leaves no room for an extended $s$-wave component to form for hole dopings ranging from strongly underdoped to slightly overdoped.",

In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study of the electronic structure of the bilayer polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the hybrid functional approach, which is well suited to tackle the non-local correlation effects arising in this system from the molecular orbital splitting of the Ni $3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states inside Ni-Ni dimers. Our calculations reveal that bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a strongly correlated magnetic system with robust Ni spin moments. Spin moments on individual Ni sites take on unusually small values because of the electron delocalization over molecular orbitals involving multiple Ni and O sites. We further find that the magnetism of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is intimately linked with charge distribution between different Ni and O orbitals. Two distinct regimes are identified in this regard. In one, molecular orbital physics drives the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band towards half-filling, which is a well-established condition for unconventional high-temperature superconductivity upon hole doping in cuprates. In the other, the Ni $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is quarter-filled favouring spin- and charge-density wave states and Ni-O bond-disproportionation, which is consistent with several recent experimental claims. It is possible that superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs as a result of a pressure-induced transition between these two competing regimes. Since none of the low energy phases discovered in this study are metallic, non-stoichiometry would be required for superconductivity to occur.",

    "summary": "Glassy solid electrolytes (GSEs), with their amorphous nature and the absence of grain boundaries, make them highly attractive for applications in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs), a leading candidate for next-generation energy storage technologies. A recently developed lithium thioborophosphate iodide GSE, composed of 30Li$_2$S-25B$_2$S$_3$-45LiI-5P$_2$S$_5$ (LBPSI), has demonstrated excellent room-temperature ionic conductivity and low activation energy. Despite this exciting finding, the underlying mechanism behind this ultrafast ion transport remains ambiguous. Here, we accurately fine-tune the foundational MACE-MP-0 model and perform large-scale machine learning molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural and ion dynamics in LBPSI GSE. Our results reveal that B$_2$S$_3$ glass formers primarily form multi-bridged B$_x$S$_y$ long-chain networks that impede Li$^+$ conduction. In contrast, P$_2$S$_5$ gives rise to mono-tetrahedral PS$_4$$^{3-}$ and di-tetrahedral P$_2$S$_7$$^{4-}$ tetrahedra, which engage in distinctive corner-sharing modes with BS$_4$$^{5-}$ tetrahedra, effectively disrupting the B$_x$S$_y$ chains and enhancing Li$^+$ mobility. Furthermore, the polyhedral anion rotations of PS$_4$$^{3-}$ and BS$_4$$^{5-}$ in the corner-sharing PS$_4$-BS$_4$ motifs may further promote fast Li$^+$ conduction.",

    "summary": "Discrete fermionic and bosonic models for hyperbolic lattices have attracted significant attention across a range of fields since the experimental realization of hyperbolic lattices in metamaterial platforms, sparking the development of hyperbolic crystallography. However, a fundamental and experimentally consequential aspect remains unaddressed: fermions propagating in curved space inherently couple to the underlying geometry via the spin connection, as required by general covariance - a feature not yet incorporated in studies of hyperbolic crystals. Here, we introduce a symmetry-based framework for Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic lattices, explicitly incorporating spin-curvature coupling via a discrete spin connection. Starting from the continuous symmetries of the Poincar\\'e disk, we classify the irreducible representations and construct a symmetry-adapted basis, establishing a direct correspondence to the continuum Dirac theory. We show that this continuum theory predicts a finite density of states at zero energy for any finite curvature in $D-$dimensional hyperbolic space with $2\\leq D \\leq 4$, suggesting enhanced susceptibility of Dirac fermions to interaction-driven instabilities at weak coupling. We then derive explicit forms of discrete translational and rotational symmetries for lattices characterized by Schl\\\"afli symbols $\\{p,q\\}$, and explicitly construct the discrete spin connection, represented as hopping phases, via parallel transport. Our results pave the way for experimental realization of spin-curvature effects in metamaterial platforms and systematic numerical studies of correlated Dirac phases in hyperbolic geometries.",

As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\\\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.",

    "summary": "Understanding the confinement mechanism in gauge theories and the universality of effective string-like descriptions of gauge flux tubes remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. We probe string modes of motion with dynamical matter in a digital quantum simulation of a (2+1) dimensional gauge theory using a superconducting quantum processor with up to 144 qubits, stretching the hardware capabilities with quantum-circuit depths comprising up to 192 two-qubit layers. We realize the $Z_2$-Higgs model ($Z_2$HM) through an optimized embedding into a heavy-hex superconducting qubit architecture, directly mapping matter and gauge fields to vertex and link superconducting qubits, respectively. Using the structure of local gauge symmetries, we implement a comprehensive suite of error suppression, mitigation, and correction strategies to enable real-time observation and manipulation of electric strings connecting dynamical charges. Our results resolve a dynamical hierarchy of longitudinal oscillations and transverse bending at the end points of the string, which are precursors to hadronization and rotational spectra of mesons. We further explore multi-string processes, observing the fragmentation and recombination of strings. The experimental design supports 300,000 measurement shots per circuit, totaling 600,000 shots per time step, enabling high-fidelity statistics. We employ extensive tensor network simulations using the basis update and Galerkin method to predict large-scale real-time dynamics and validate our error-aware protocols. This work establishes a milestone for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics via superconducting quantum simulation and elucidates the real-time behavior of confining strings.",

We propose a framework to compute Greeks in a single evaluation of a tensor train (TT), which is obtained by compressing the Fourier transform (FT)-based pricing function via TT learning using tensor cross interpolation. Based on this TT representation, we introduce two approaches to compute Greeks: a numerical differentiation (ND) approach that applies a numerical differential operator to one tensor core and an analytical (AN) approach that constructs the TT of closed-form differentiation expressions of FT-based pricing. Numerical experiments on a five-asset min-call option in the Black-Sholes model show significant speed-ups of up to about $10^{5} \\times$ over MC while maintaining comparable accuracy. The ND approach matches or exceeds the accuracy of the AN approach and requires lower computational complexity for constructing the TT representation, making it the preferred choice.",

Our calculation reveals dramatically different material-dependent behaviors: while five- and six-phonon processes remain negligible in Si, they become increasingly important in MgO and dominant in BaO near its melting point, where they surpass three- and four-phonon scattering intensity and significantly reduce lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate that the strength of higher-order interactions is primarily governed by interatomic force constants, with BaO exhibiting five- and six-phonon scattering rates over one order of magnitude stronger than MgO despite identical crystal structures, due to large scattering phase space arising from softened harmonic interactions. Our work establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials and at elevated temperatures.",

    "summary": "Empirical rate-and-state friction laws are widely used in geophysics and engineering to simulate interface slip. They postulate that the friction coefficient depends on the local slip rate and a state variable that reflects the history of slip. Depending on the parameters, rate-and-state friction can be either rate-strengthening, leading to steady slip, or rate-weakening, leading to unsteady stick-slip behavior modeling earthquakes. Rate-and-state friction does not have a potential or variational formulation, making implicit solution approaches difficult and implementation numerically expensive. In this work, we propose a potential formulation for the rate-and-state friction. We formulate the potentials as neural networks and train them so that the resulting behavior emulates the empirical rate-and-state friction. We show that this potential formulation enables implicit time discretization leading to efficient numerical implementation.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in machine learning have enabled large-scale atomic simulations with first-principles accuracy, allowing precise modeling of disordered materials such as glassy carbon (GC). However, conventional ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) cannot effectively capture anisotropic stress effects, which are believed to play a key role in the transformation of GC into amorphous diamond under extreme conditions. In this work, we present an on-the-fly machine learning-augmented constrained AIMD (ML-augmented CAIMD) approach by modifying VASP 6.3.2. Our simulations not only reproduce major experimental features of GC but also provide restrictive synthesis conditions and microscopic insights. We show that GC exhibits unexpectedly high plasticity, with its compressive and shear strengths enhanced by large strains. Under pressure, increasing annealing temperature promotes the formation of quenchable amorphous diamond via enhanced sp3 preservation, but this trend reverses above 2900 K due to thermal graphitization. Under non-hydrostatic compression, GC transforms into a superhard structure sustaining large stress differences, which sharply increase when confining pressure exceeds 40 GPa. Finally, severe rotational shear at 30 GPa induces sp3 fractions up to 80 percent at 300 to 1000 K. A hardened amorphous carbon retaining 64 percent sp3 content is achieved by decompression at 300 K, marking the lowest pressure-temperature route ever predicted. Our ML-augmented CAIMD provides a general framework for modeling structural transformations in disordered materials under anisotropic stresses.",

    "summary": "High entropy alloys (HEAs) offer unprecedented compositional flexibility for designing advanced materials, yet predicting their crystallographic phases remains a key bottleneck due to limited data and complex phase formation behavior. Here, we present a quantum-enhanced machine learning framework that leverages quantum annealing to enhance phase classification in HEAs. Our pipeline integrates Quantum Boosting (QBoost) for interpretable feature selection and classification, with Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) that use quantum-enhanced kernels to capture nonlinear relationships between physical descriptors. By reformulating both models as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, we exploit the efficient sampling capabilities of quantum annealers to achieve rapid training and robust generalization, demonstrating notable runtime reductions relative to classical baselines in our setup. We target six key phases: FCC, BCC, Sigma, Laves, Heusler, and AlXY B2, and benchmark model performance using both cross-validation and a rigorously curated test set of prior experimentally synthesized HEAs. The results confirm strong alignment between predicted and measured phases. Our findings demonstrate that quantum-enhanced classifiers match or exceed classical models in accuracy and offer insights grounded in interpretable physical descriptors. This work constitutes an important step toward practical quantum acceleration in materials discovery pipelines.",

    "summary": "The sublattice current is recently proposed as a feasible scheme to realize the odd-parity altermagnetism(ALM) by breaking the nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry. We first adopt the spin group method to analyze why the broken nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS) is the sufficient condition for the odd-parity ALM, and find that it is the symmetry $[\\bar{C}_2||\\bar{E}]$ that allows the appearance of the odd-parity ALM where $\\bar{C}_2$ represents a $180^\\circ$ rotation around an axis perpendicular to the spins combined with the spin-space inversion, and $\\bar{E}$ is the inversion in real space. As a representative example with the presence of sublattice currents, the optical conductivity of Haldane-Hubbard model is further studied using the Kubo formula. It is shown that there is no spin-polarized electrical current in both the longitudinal and traverse directions because of TRS in the odd-parity ALM, and they display a significant peak in the vicinity of the single-particle direct energy gap which reflects that both the longitudinal and traverse optical conductivities are dominated by the quasiparticle excitations around the Dirac points. We also study the hole doping dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity $\\sigma_{\\rm Hall}$ as well as the staggered magnetization $M$, and find that they display opposite behaviors, i.e., $\\sigma_{\\rm Hall}$ in the ALM CI state is diminished monotonically from its initial value $C=2$ at half-filling as the hole doping is increased, while in the ALMI state exhibits a non-monotonous behavior.",

The electronic phases include partially charge-ordered metal or insulator, and fully charge-ordered insulator. The different magnetic phases of the model are non-magnet, spin density wave, spin split compensated ferrimagnet or partial antiferromagnet. Analysis of the electronic band structure reveals that the partially charge-ordered compensated ferrimagnetic phase exhibits spin polarisation, which can be quite interesting for spintronics applications. We also compute the polarisation as a function of $U$ using the Berry phase formalism and show that the system exhibits multiferroicity with coexisting compensated ferrimagnetic spin order alongside electronic polarisations.",

While ab initio molecular dynamics methods are highly accurate, they are limited by short accessible time and length scales whereas classical force fields struggle with accuracy. Herein, we explore the structure and thermodynamics of complex monovalent-divalent ion pairs using Na2SO4(aq) as a case study by applying a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained on density functional theory (DFT) data. Our MLIP-based approach reproduces key bulk properties such as density and radial distribution functions of water. We provide the hydration structure of the sodium and sulfate ions in 0.1-2 M concentration range and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional potentials of mean force for the sodium-sulfate ion pairing at the low concentration limit (0.1 M) which are inaccessible to DFT. At low concentrations, the sulfate ion is strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion pairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that coordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby the sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially. We demonstrate that MLIPs allow the study of solvated ions beyond simple monovalent pairs with DFT-level accuracy in their low concentration limit (0.1 M) via statistically converged properties from ns long simulations.",

In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically. The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming quantum technologies.",

    "summary": "Motivated by recent experimental advancements in scanning optical stroboscopic confocal microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, which have facilitated exceptional energy-space-time resolution for investigating edge and bulk dynamics in fractional quantum Hall systems, we formulated a model for the pump-probe process on the edge. Starting with a ground state, we applied a tip potential near the fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, which was subsequently turned off after a defined time duration. By examining how the specific nature of the tip potential influences the evolution of the wave function and its distribution in energy spectrum, we identify that quench dynamics of the edge pulse leads to excitations that spread both along the edge and perpendicularly into the bulk. Moreover, magnetoroton excitations are predominant among the bulk excitations. These results align well with the experimental observations. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of the tip's position, intensity, and duration on the dynamics.",

This study reveals a surprisingly high level of redundancy in such datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and complex alloys. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that large, exhaustive datasets are necessary for accurate ML predictions of electronic structure. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy, while a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data and reducing training time by threefold or more. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate seemingly redundant data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors, possibly due to the significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high degree of redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.",

Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA) is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D lattice.",

    "summary": "Tensor Network (TN) decompositions have emerged as an indispensable tool in Big Data analytics owing to their ability to provide compact low-rank representations, thus alleviating the ``Curse of Dimensionality'' inherent in handling higher-order data. At the heart of their success lies the concept of TN ranks, which governs the efficiency and expressivity of TN decompositions. However, unlike matrix ranks, TN ranks often lack a universal meaning and an intuitive interpretation, with their properties varying significantly across different TN structures. Consequently, TN ranks are frequently treated as empirically tuned hyperparameters, rather than as key design parameters inferred from domain knowledge. The aim of this Lecture Note is therefore to demystify the foundational yet frequently misunderstood concept of TN ranks through real-life examples and intuitive visualizations. We begin by illustrating how domain knowledge can guide the selection of TN ranks in widely-used models such as the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker decompositions. For more complex TN structures, we employ a self-explanatory graphical approach that generalizes to tensors of arbitrary order. Such a perspective naturally reveals the relationship between TN ranks and the corresponding ranks of tensor unfoldings (matrices), thereby circumventing cumbersome multi-index tensor algebra while facilitating domain-informed TN design. It is our hope that this Lecture Note will equip readers with a clear and unified understanding of the concept of TN rank, along with the necessary physical insight and intuition to support the selection, explainability, and deployment of tensor methods in both practical applications and educational contexts.",

The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.",

    "summary": "Quantum phase transitions are typically marked by changes in quantum correlations across various spatial scales within the system. A key challenge lies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal quantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be insufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as superconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations, we show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations, occupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of off-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of the superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of particle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While this symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it allows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal correlations.",

Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E, defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\\Delta = 2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality. These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical investigation into the foundations of emergent space.",

As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\\\"odinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.",

    "summary": "Motivated by recent developments in the study of quasi-one-dimensional iron systems with Fe$^{2+}$, we comprehensively study the Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide chain system. Based on first-principles calculations, the Fe$^{3+}$ chain has a similar electronic structure as discussed before in the iron 2+ chain, due to similar Fe$X_4$ ($X$ = S or Se) tetrahedron chain geometry. Furthermore, a three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth). Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$ chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems. Our results establish with clarity the similarities and differences between Fe$^{2+}$and Fe$^{3+}$ iron chains, as well as iron ladders.",

Additionally, how the doped holes in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ are distributed among different orbitals remain unresolved. Motivated by recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we theoretically study the electronic structure of infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at various doping levels. We find that, unlike the expectation from a rigid band shift, holes are equally distributed to Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and interstitial-$s$ orbitals. The role of interstitial-$s$ orbital is further confirmed from the renormalization of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, for which the coupling between interstitial-$s$ and Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ exerts a non-negligible impact on the orbital-selective renormalization observed in ARPES. We also discuss the implication of our results to the single-band model, where the interstitial-$s$ orbital in the normal state of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ acts as charge donator enhancing the correlation of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ by increasing its concentration close to half-filling.",

Focusing on the systems with hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) higher than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL are generically beneficial for global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the possibility of $d$-wave superconductivity solely hosted in the IL. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.",

The general strategy is to break the inversion symmetry of conventional antiferromagnets or the rotational/mirror symmetry of altermagnets to achieve fully-compensated ferrimagnets. Here, we propose to induce fully-compensated ferrimagnetism by engineering the spin ordering rather than modifying the lattice structure. Bilayer stacking engineering offers a convenient platform to verify our proposal and readily enables switching between two distinct electronic states by tuning the $\\mathrm{N\\acute{e}el}$ vector of one layer. By the first-principles calculations, a bilayer system is constructed with monolayer $\\mathrm{Cr_2C_2S_6}$ as the elementary building block to corroborate our proposal. This strategy can also be extended to inducing altermagnetism via spin ordering engineering. Our work offers an alternative route to realize non-relativistic spin splitting in zero-net-magnetization magnets, paving the way for the advancement and construction of low-power spintronic device.",

    "summary": "We introduce the concept of natural super-orbitals for many-body operators, defined as the eigenvectors of the one-body super-density matrix associated with a vectorized operator. We first analyze the general analytical properties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact matrix-product-operator representation in the natural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time scales.",

    "summary": "The classical outer optimisation loop of the classical-quantum hybrid Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) can be bypassed by transferring precomputed parameters to larger unseen problem instances using the parameter concentration property found in certain classes of problem instances. In this paper, parameter transfer is applied to the recursive-QAOA (RQAOA) approach of Bravyi et al. implementing the Binary Paint Shop Problem (BPSP) -- an optimisation problem found in manufacturing where a sequence of cars are to be painted under certain constraints while minimising the number of colour changes between cars. The BPSP can be conveniently formulated as an Ising ground state problem with a symmetric Hamiltonian and Ising graph structure that is well-suited for QAOA parameter-transfer techniques. Throughout our quantum simulated experiments, parameter transfer showed no noticeable reduction in solution quality over optimisation for QAOA and RQAOA while substantially improving the efficiency due to avoiding measurements required for optimisation. Additionally, RQAOA only requires measurements of $ZZ$-correlations instead of full statevectors, benefiting from the reverse-causal-cone feature that leads to circuits with significantly lower CNOT counts and depths. The performance of QAOA and RQAOA with parameter transfer is benchmarked against classical solvers and heuristics and their resilience to non-optimal parameters is explored. The entanglement entropy and bond dimensions are obtained from matrix product state simulations to provide an indication of the classical resources required to simulate the quantum algorithms. Circuit sizes and measurement counts are compared between the implementations.",

Recently, neural quantum states have emerged as a promising approach for studying correlated fermions, highlighted by the hidden fermion and backflow methods, which use neural networks to model corrections to fermionic quasiparticle orbitals. In this work, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that naturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion Pfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and superconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic complexity. In our numerical experiments, HFPS provides state-of-the-art variational accuracy in different regimes of both the attractive and repulsive Hubbard models. We show that the HFPS is able to capture both s-wave and d-wave pairing, and therefore may be a useful tool for modeling phases with unconventional superconductivity.",

    "summary": "Quantum dots (QDs) exhibit unique properties arising from their reduced size and quantum confinement effects, including exceptionally bright and tunable photoluminescence. Among these, CuInS$_{2}$ QDs have gained significant attention owing to their remarkable broadband emission, making them highly desirable for various optoelectronic applications requiring efficient luminescent nanomaterials. However, maximizing radiative recombination in CuInS$_{2}$ QDs often necessitates minimizing intragap trap states. A common approach involves the introduction of Zn during the synthesis, which typically promotes the formation of a ZnS shell that passivates the QD surface.   Despite its importance, the characterization and quantification of Zn incorporation using conventional techniques, such as optical spectroscopy or electron microscopy, remains challenging. In this study, we utilized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in both X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectral ranges, to investigate Zn incorporation into CuInS$_{2}$ QDs with element-specific precision. This approach allowed us to detect the formation of a ZnS surface shell and to resolve the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD lattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent, or as an interstitial defect.   Additionally, we explored the optical and dynamical properties of CuInS$_{2}$ QDs using time-resolved optical spectroscopies, particularly in the presence of electron and hole acceptors. These results provide deeper insights into the role and effectiveness of the Zn-induced passivating layer, paving the way for optimizing QD performance in photoluminescence applications.",

Measured data were analyzed by several approaches including atomic, crystal-field theory and the Anderson impurity model to take into account the hybridization of actinide valence states with oxygen $2p$ states. For Th(IV), the $5f$ states are mainly affected by the crystal-field interaction with the closest neighbors as can be seen from the corresponding spectrum of ThO$_2$. In turn, for U(VI) and U(V) oxides, the U $5f$-O $2p$ hybridization and high degree of covalency in the chemical bonding play a decisive role increasing the $5f$ occupancy and consequently governing the ground and excited state properties. That is additionally illustrated by results from the calculations of the U $5d$ x-ray photoemission spectra for U(V) in the lattice of La-doped UO$_2$.",

This quantics tensor train diagnostics approach allows us to i) identify quantum phase transitions (ground state crossings) and thermal crossovers, ii) distinguish between these two by allowing flexibility through iii) using arbitrary available correlators and iv) the possibility to deal with low-accuracy input data through varying the quantics tensor train cutoffs. We verify the validity of the approach by studying the phase diagram of the Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. We find time scale entanglement to be a system-inherent property becoming maximal at phase transitions and crossover, which translates to peaks in the quantics tensor train bond dimension of correlator functions. Additionally, the connection of the method to other physical quantities, such as various entanglement measures and susceptibilities, is shown.",

Conventional cuprates typically contain perfect CuO$_2$ planes which are considered as a key factor to superconductivity since the superconductivity takes place in them. However, in Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\\delta}$ with $\\delta=0.2$ and O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes, superconductivity still arises even with a transition temperature as high as 73 K. Using combined density functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations, we investigated the electronic correlation and electronic structure of Ba$_2$CuO$_{3.25}$ with alternating quasi-one-dimensional (1D) CuO planes and O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes. We find that although different from the usual cuprates, the Cu atoms are still dominated by a 3$d^9$ configuration and the system is of a new kind of correlated single-orbital physics. The quasi-1D CuO planes, composed of parallel Cu-O chains, are slightly hole-doped quasi-1D Mott insulator, while the O-depleted CuO$_2$ planes are more hole doped, with a 2D correlated electronic structure, and may host superconductivity.",

We also show that to order $1/S^2$ the ground state energy is not sensitive to the component of the interaction which is responsible for altermagnetism. At the $\\Gamma$-point the $1/S$-correction to the magnon dispersion vanishes so that quantum fluctuations do not induce a gap in the magnon spectrum of altermagnets, as expected by Goldstone's theorem. We extract the leading $1/S$-corrections to the spin-wave velocity and the effective mass characterizing the curvature of the magnon dispersion in altermagnets.",

We then use our approach as impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to address the case of a two-orbital, realistic layered structure, recovering the strong crystal-field-driven charge polarization observed by solving the DMFT self-consistent cycle with QMC, albeit slightly reduced. Finally, we address a prototype nonequilibrium setup by sandwiching this layer between metallic contacts subject to a bias voltage described by different chemical potentials. This simplified model demonstrates out method's potential to access nonequilibrium steady-state behavior of multi-orbital, realistic materials. These findings provide a first-step basis for theoretical studies of nonequilibrium properties of multi-orbital compounds directly in the real frequency domain.",

We then employ a generalized version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the circuit. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths.

    "summary": "A central challenge for understanding unconventional superconductivity in most strongly correlated electronic materials is their complicated band structure and presence of competing orders. In contrast, quasi-two-dimensional organic spin liquids are single-band systems with superconductivity arising near the bandwidth-tuned Mott metal-insulator transition in the absence of other orders. Here, we study chemically substituted $\\kappa$-organics in which superconducting fluctuations emerge in the phase coexistence region between the Mott insulator and the Fermi liquid. Using magnetotransport and ac susceptibility measurements, we find that global superconductivity fails to set in as temperature $T\\rightarrow 0$. Our results indicate instead the presence of superconducting domains embedded in the metallic percolating cluster that undergo a magnetic field-tuned quantum superconductor-to-metal phase transition. Surprisingly, albeit consistent with the percolation picture, universal conductance fluctuations are seen at high fields in macroscopic samples. The observed interplay of the intrinsic inhomogeneity and quantum phase fluctuations provides a new insight into failed superconductivity, a phenomenon seen in various conventional and unconventional superconductors, including cuprates.",

    "summary": "We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$, formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site, along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and $U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral function exhibits \"Fermi arcs\", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al. (arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field, aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al. (arXiv:2411.10631).",

    "summary": "Bilayer nickelates exhibit high-temperature superconductivity under proper hydrostatic pressure or epitaxial strain, signifying the emergence of quantum phase transitions whose physical mechanisms remain unclear. Using a minimal bilayer Hubbard model incorporating only the essential Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, we demonstrate that a phase transition naturally arises from tuning the ratio of intralayer to interlayer hopping amplitudes. The transition point separates regimes with a rich interplay between superconducting and density-wave orders. In the regime with weaker intralayer hopping, quasi-long-range spin-density-wave and pair-density-wave orders coexist, with the former being dominant. Across the transition, the spin-density-wave order becomes short-ranged, accompanied by the emergence of the quasi-long-range charge-density-wave order. Most significantly, superconductivity is dramatically enhanced in this regime, though it no longer exhibits the pair-density-wave signature. This quantum phase transition, driven by the competition between intralayer and interlayer hopping, provides a plausible microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed correlation between the superconducting transition temperature and ratio of out-of-plane to in-plane lattice constants. Our findings may assist future efforts in optimizing experimental conditions to further enhance superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.",

The collinear magnets with net-zero magnetization and spin-splitting mainly include altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet, which provide possibility to achieve hidden spin polarization (HSP) with net-zero spin polarization in total but non-zero local spin polarization. In addition to proposal of hidden altermagnetism, we hereby introduce this concept of hidden fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, where the total spin polarization is zero, but either of the two inversion-partner sectors possesses fully-compensated ferrimagnetism with non-zero local spin polarization in the real space. By the first-principle calculations, we predict that $PT$-bilayer $\\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_6}$ is a possible hidden fully-compensated ferrimagnet, showing fully-compensated ferrimagnetic HSP, which can be separated and observed by an out-of-plane external electric field.

    "summary": "Tensor Network (TN) Kernel Machines speed up model learning by representing parameters as low-rank TNs, reducing computation and memory use. However, most TN-based Kernel methods are deterministic and ignore parameter uncertainty. Further, they require manual tuning of model complexity hyperparameters like tensor rank and feature dimensions, often through trial-and-error or computationally costly methods like cross-validation. We propose Bayesian Tensor Network Kernel Machines, a fully probabilistic framework that uses sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors on TN factors to automatically infer model complexity. This enables automatic inference of tensor rank and feature dimensions, while also identifying the most relevant features for prediction, thereby enhancing model interpretability. All the model parameters and hyperparameters are treated as latent variables with corresponding priors. Given the Bayesian approach and latent variable dependencies, we apply a mean-field variational inference to approximate their posteriors. We show that applying a mean-field approximation to TN factors yields a Bayesian ALS algorithm with the same computational complexity as its deterministic counterpart, enabling uncertainty quantification at no extra computational cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and scalability.",

Although the corresponding band structure modifications below the CDW transition temperature are well established, only a few reports discuss the occurrence of the CDW fluctuating phase and its spectral features well above the transition temperature. Here, we report the direct observation of spectral features associated with CDW fluctuations at 295 K, using time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy. We investigated the transient melting and recovery of CDW fluctuations upon nonresonant ultrafast photoexcitation. Surprisingly, our results reveal that the coherent amplitude mode modulating the ultrafast CDW recovery persists at these elevated temperatures. The time-, energy- and momentum-resolved photoemission data supported by density functional perturbation theory further confirm that CDW fluctuations at these elevated temperatures are dominated by electron-phonon interaction. The analysis of these very localized microscopic fluctuations consequently provides new insights into the complex interplay between the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom at elevated temperatures and, therefore, on the nature of this quantum phase transition.",

    "summary": "Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and improve the known {\\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8 and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A final formula using {\\mu}/t, {\\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.",

While the latter involves a single many-body Green's function, the former uses a multichannel Green's function in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. Quasiparticles and satellites are thus naturally treated on equal footing in the multichannel Dyson equation. To assess the accuracy of our approach we apply it here to the ground- and excited-state properties of the extended Hubbard dimer, an exactly solvable model for $H_2$. In particular, we focus on the potential energy surface as well as the corresponding spectral functions and HOMO-LUMO gaps, which are well-known challenges for many-body approximations such as second Born and $GW$. We show that the multichannel Dyson equation gives overall very good results for all properties considered and outperforms both $GW$ and second Born. In particular, the multichannel Dyson equation yields the correct ground-state energy and HOMO-LUMO gap in the dissociation limit contrary to $GW$.",

    "summary": "Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating atomistic simulations, offering scalable and efficient modeling with accuracy close to quantum calculations. However, their reliability and effectiveness in practical, real-world applications remain an open question. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related nanoporous materials are highly porous crystals with critical relevance in carbon capture, energy storage, and catalysis applications. Modeling nanoporous materials presents distinct challenges for uMLIPs due to their diverse chemistry, structural complexity, including porosity and coordination bonds, and the absence from existing training datasets. Here, we introduce MOFSimBench, a benchmark to evaluate uMLIPs on key materials modeling tasks for nanoporous materials, including structural optimization, molecular dynamics (MD) stability, the prediction of bulk properties, such as bulk modulus and heat capacity, and guest-host interactions. Evaluating over 20 models from various architectures on a chemically and structurally diverse materials set, we find that top-performing uMLIPs consistently outperform classical force fields and fine-tuned machine learning potentials across all tasks, demonstrating their readiness for deployment in nanoporous materials modeling. Our analysis highlights that data quality, particularly the diversity of training sets and inclusion of out-of-equilibrium conformations, plays a more critical role than model architecture in determining performance across all evaluated uMLIPs. We release our modular and extendable benchmarking framework at https://github.com/AI4ChemS/mofsim-bench, providing an open resource to guide the adoption for nanoporous materials modeling and further development of uMLIPs.",

In this work, we investigate how the choice of mapping from a two-dimensional lattice to a one-dimensional path affects the accuracy of the two-dimensional Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm. We systematically evaluate all mappings corresponding to a subset of the Hamiltonian paths of the $N \\cross N$ grid graphs up to $N=8$ and demonstrate that the fractal space-filling curves generally lead to faster convergence in ground state searches compared to the commonly used ``snake\" path. To explain this performance gain, we analyze various locality metrics and propose a scalable method for constructing high-performing paths on larger lattices by tiling smaller optimal paths. Our results show that such paths consistently improve simulation convergence, with the advantage increasing with system size.",

    "summary": "The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we introduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the measurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact (trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all within a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22 THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via parametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency. Our studies reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective excitations and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast phenomena.",

    "summary": "The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary- and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve large-scale quantum impurity problems.",

    "summary": "Computational screening has become a powerful complement to experimental efforts in the discovery of high-performance photovoltaic (PV) materials. Most workflows rely on density functional theory (DFT) to estimate electronic and optical properties relevant to solar energy conversion. Although more efficient than laboratory-based methods, DFT calculations still entail substantial computational and environmental costs. Machine learning (ML) models have recently gained attention as surrogates for DFT, offering drastic reductions in resource use with competitive predictive performance. In this study, we reproduce a canonical DFT-based workflow to estimate the maximum efficiency limit and progressively replace its components with ML surrogates. By quantifying the CO$_2$ emissions associated with each computational strategy, we evaluate the trade-offs between predictive efficacy and environmental cost. Our results reveal multiple hybrid ML/DFT strategies that optimize different points along the accuracy--emissions front. We find that direct prediction of scalar quantities, such as maximum efficiency, is significantly more tractable than using predicted absorption spectra as an intermediate step. Interestingly, ML models trained on DFT data can outperform DFT workflows using alternative exchange--correlation functionals in screening applications, highlighting the consistency and utility of data-driven approaches. We also assess strategies to improve ML-driven screening through expanded datasets and improved model architectures tailored to PV-relevant features. This work provides a quantitative framework for building low-emission, high-throughput discovery pipelines.",

On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators. We also explore a connection between higher Berry connections and functional Berry connections in the loop spaces of boundary conformal manifolds.",

    "summary": "Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) is an emerging field aimed at automating the design of quantum circuits for optimal performance. This paper introduces a novel QAS framework employing hybrid quantum reinforcement learning with quantum curriculum learning strategies, enabling learning agents to tackle increasingly complex quantum circuit design tasks. We benchmark four state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDQN, TD3) against their quantum-enhanced counterparts (QA2C, QPPO, QDDQN, QTD3) for optimizing variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Our approach progressively increases circuit depth and gate complexity during training, leveraging parameterized quantum circuits as function approximations. To improve learning efficiency and stability, all algorithms, both classical and quantum, are augmented with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). Experimental results show that quantum-enhanced RL significantly outperforms classical methods. In a 2-qubit environment, PERQDDQN achieves a success probability of 0.46 with ~3,000 optimal successes, surpassing classical PERDDQN (0.42, ~2,400). In the more complex 3-qubit setting, PERQDDQN and PERQTD3 reach success probabilities of ~0.47, with optimal success counts of ~3,800 and ~3,600, respectively, outperforming their classical counterparts. Additionally, we apply our QAS-QTN approach to a classification problem, where the optimized quantum circuit achieves an accuracy of 90.33\\%, outperforming quantum models consisting of random ansatz. This hybrid classical-quantum approach leads to faster convergence and more efficient quantum circuit designs, demonstrating its potential for advancing automated quantum architecture search.",

The transition is found to involve both diffusive and diffusionless mechanisms. Nucleation of 1T$^\\prime$ phase is initiated by the coalescence of neighboring Te monovacancies into divacancies, which are found to be mobile and can interact with other Te vacancies to form small triangular 1T$^\\prime$ islands. Growth of these islands proceeds either by incorporating pre-existing vacancies at the phase boundaries or, in their absence, by absorbing divacancies that migrate from the surrounding lattice. Once a critical island size is reached, vacancy-free growth becomes possible although with a higher activation barrier. Upon removal of external stimuli, the system reverts to 2H phase, during which Te vacancies reorganize into three-fold spoke-like vacancy lines at the island center. This reverse process and the subsequent 1T$^\\prime$$\\leftrightarrow$2H reversible transitions are diffusionless, rapid, do not require additional vacancies and can be driven by mild external stimuli. Although our analysis focuses on strain-induced transitions, the kinetic mechanisms are expected to be generalizable to other types of stimuli.",

    "summary": "The Self-Learning Monte Carlo (SLMC) method is a Monte Carlo approach that has emerged in recent years by integrating concepts from machine learning with conventional Monte Carlo techniques. Designed to accelerate the numerical study of interacting many-body systems, SLMC significantly improves sampling efficiency by constructing an effective model -- via machine learning methods -- based on configurations generated by conventional Monte Carlo methods and then proposes global updates based on the effective model. This enhancement leads to a substantial reduction in autocorrelation time, especially near the critical region, where traditional methods typically suffer from critical slowing down and increased computation complexity. Moreover, SLMC maintains statistical accuracy by implementing a cumulative update scheme that rigorously satisfies the detailed balance condition. And more recent applications have extended the SLMC to convolutional neural networks with applications not only in condensed matter physics but also high-energy physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum simulations. The generic applicability and high computational efficiency make SLMC a powerful and scalable framework for quantum Monte Carlo simulations of strongly correlated electron systems, extending the reach of numerical investigations beyond the limitations of conventional techniques.",

In order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of magic - a {\\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.",

At half-filling and for interaction strengths and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence, carried out dynamical vertex approximation (D$\\Gamma$A) simulations which allow for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the local ones of DMFT. Our numerical data show that close to half-filling the large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain doping value charge fluctuations become eventually larger in D$\\Gamma$A with respect to DMFT indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime. This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the D$\\Gamma$A kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute value of the) D$\\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT.",

    "summary": "We present and test a protocol to learn the matrix-product operator (MPO) representation of an experimentally prepared quantum state. The protocol takes as an input classical shadows corresponding to local randomized measurements, and outputs the tensors of a MPO which maximizes a suitably-defined fidelity with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum processor. Our method upgrades classical shadows to large-scale quantum computation and simulation experiments.",

    "summary": "Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF) circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states, including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF circuit that implements a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i) measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.",

In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.",

Employing density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) that incorporates dynamical electronic correlation, we demonstrate that CaCrO$_3$ is a strongly correlated altermagnet. Our DFT+DMFT calculations successfully reproduce the correlated metallic behavior of CaCrO$_3$ and quantitatively capture the incoherence state observed experimentally. We also identify that the altermagnetic CaCrO$_3$ is a Hund's metal with a non-Fermi liquid behavior. Moreover, we find that altermagnetism can induce flat bands, and these incipient flat bands are further promoted by the strong renormalization from Hundness, which drives a heavy-fermion behavior. Hence, we propose that Hund's metals provide an ideal platform for hosting novel strongly correlated altermagnetism. Our work will promote the study of strongly correlated altermagnetism physics.",

We systematically investigate the band structures and electronic correlation effect to identify the key factors controlling superconductivity and pathways to enhance $T_c$. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct a bilayer two-orbital ($3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$) tight-binding model for a series of in-plane compression mimicking the substrate effect. We find the band energy at the $M$ point drops with the compression, leading to increase of the density of states at the Fermi level, in stark contrast to the behavior of the bulk under pressure. We then apply functional renormalization group (FRG) method to study the electronic correlation effect on the superconductivity. We find the $s_\\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust in the films, the same as the bulk. But somewhat surprisingly, for the films, we find $T_c$ can be enhanced by reducing the in-plane lattice constant, increasing the out-of-plane lattice constant, or further electron-doping. These findings are consistent with the itinerant picture of the superconductivity induced by spin-fluctuations and provide theoretical support for further boosting $T_c$ in future experiments.",

    "summary": "Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning. In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.",

    "summary": "Intertwined charge and spin correlations are ubiquitous in a wide range of transition metal oxides and are often perceived as intimately related to unconventional superconductivity. Theoretically envisioned as driven by strong electronic correlations, the intertwined order is usually found to be strongly coupled to the lattice as signaled by pronounced phonon softening. Recently, both charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) and superconductivity have been discovered in several Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates, in particular trilayer nickelates RE4Ni3O10 (RE=Pr, La). The nature of the intertwined order and the role of lattice-charge coupling are at the heart of the debate about these materials. Using inelastic X-ray scattering, we mapped the phonon dispersions in RE4Ni3O10 and found no evidence of phonon softening near the CDW wavevector over a wide temperature range. Calculations of the electronic susceptibility revealed a peak at the observed SDW ordering vector but not at the CDW wavevector. The absence of phonon softening is in sharp contrast to that in canonical oxide materials, notably cuprates. Our experimental and theoretical findings highlight the crucial role of the spin degree of freedom and establish a foundation for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and density-wave transitions in RP nickelate superconductors and beyond.",

Leveraging a newly developed SpinGNN++ framework that effectively handles spin-lattice coupled systems, we develop a comprehensive interatomic machine learning (ML) potential and apply it to twisted bilayer NiI2 (TBN). Structural relaxation introduces moir\\'e-periodic \"bumps\" that modulate the interlayer spacing by about 0.55~\\AA{} and in-plane ionic shifts up to 0.48~\\AA{}. Concurrently, our ML potential, which faithfully captures all key spin interactions, produces reliable magnetic configurations; combined with the generalized KNB mechanism, it yields accurate spin-driven polarization. For twist angles 1.89^{\\circ} \\leq \\theta \\leq 2.45^{\\circ}, both mechanisms become prominent, yielding rich polarization textures that combine ionic out-of-plane dipoles with purely electronic in-plane domains. In the rigid (unrelaxed) bilayer, skyrmions are absent; lattice relaxation is essential for generating polar-magnetic topologies. In contrast, near {\\theta} \\approx 60^{\\circ}, stacking-dependent ferroelectric displacements dominate, giving rise to polar meron-antimeron networks. These results reveal cooperative ionic and spin-driven ferroelectricity in TBN, positioning twisted vdW magnets as adaptable platforms for tunable multiferroic devices.",

    "summary": "Advanced structure prediction methods developed over the past decades include an unorthodox strategy of allowing atoms to displace into extra dimensions. A recently implemented global optimization of structures from hyperspace (GOSH) has shown promise in accelerating the identification of global minima on potential energy surfaces defined by simple interatomic models. In this study, we extend the GOSH formalism to more accurate Behler-Parrinello neural network (NN) potentials, make it compatible with efficient local minimization algorithms, and test its performance on nanoparticles and crystalline solids. For clusters modeled with NN potentials, four-dimensional optimization offers fairly modest improvement in navigating geometric relaxation pathways and incurs increased computational cost largely offsetting the benefit, but it provides a significant advantage in facilitating atom swaps in nanoalloys. In comparison, the introduction of a moderate, controlled bias for generating more physically sensible starting configurations, achieved via TETRIS-inspired packing of atomic blocks, has a more direct impact on the efficiency of global structure searches. The benchmarked systems are Lennard-Jones clusters, Au or Cu-Pd-Ag nanoparticles and binary Sn alloys described by NN potentials, and compounds with covalent B or BC frameworks modeled with density functional theory",

    "summary": "Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science and many-body physics, yet quantifying it in mixed quantum many-body systems has remained a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we introduce families of quantitative entanglement witnesses, constructed from partial transpose and realignment moments, which provide rigorous bounds on entanglement monotones. Our witnesses can be efficiently measured using SWAP tests or variants of Bell measurements, thus making them directly implementable on current hardware. Leveraging our witnesses, we present several novel results on entanglement properties of mixed states, both in quantum information and many-body physics. We develop efficient algorithms to test whether mixed states with bounded entropy have low or high entanglement, which previously was only possible for pure states. We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank using only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using four-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of quantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has been limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement phase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose negativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result that also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of entanglement in extensive many-body systems. Finally, we make progress on the entanglement required for quantum cryptography, establishing rigorous limits on pseudoentanglement and pseudorandom density matrices with bounded entropy. Our work opens new avenues for quantifying entanglement in large and noisy quantum systems.",

In this work, we use an infinite Density Matrix Renormalization Group (iDMRG) algorithm to quantitatively characterize the properties of confined strings. To this end, we stabilize the state with a string excitation by 't Hooft loop operators. While for zero gauge-matter coupling we can use bare 't Hooft loop operators to do so, for finite gauge-matter coupling we have to transform them to emergent ones, which we achieve with an adiabatic protocol.

    "summary": "Recently, the study of novel physical properties arising from the combination of altermagnetism and other matter phases has attracted widespread attention, such as the integration of altermagnetism and topology. However, research on the combination of altermagnetism and charge density waves remains relatively sparse. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate for the first time that altermagnetism and charge density waves can coexist in a two-dimensional material and predict monolayer WO to be such a material. Moreover, our calculations reveal that the altermagnetic order in monolayer WO stabilizes the $\\sqrt{2}\\times\\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave. Further, the $\\sqrt{2}\\times\\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave is not driven by Fermi-surface nesting but rather by strong electron-phonon coupling. More importantly, the $\\sqrt{2}\\times\\sqrt{2}$ charge density wave in monolayer WO leads to an anomalous transition from semimetal to metal. Therefore, we realize an anomalous charge density wave phase in altermagnetic WO. Considering the strong electron-phonon coupling and good metallic properties in the altermagnetic charge density wave state, our work may provide new insights into the realization of nontrivial altermagnetic superconductivity.",

First-principles calculations reveal that even minute Ni doping induces a substantial shift in the Fermi level (EF) and alters the density of states (DOS). Structural analysis via Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data shows anomalous behavior at x = 0.02, supported by Williamson-Hall and modified methods. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ti and Co K-edges further confirms a pronounced local structural change at this composition. These structural transitions are consistent with temperature-dependent resistivity (\\rho(T)) and thermopower (S(T)) data, which reflect changes in EF and disorder. Analysis of Lorentz number and scattering parameters reinforces the observed modifications in the electronic structure. The simultaneous enhancement of S and electrical conductivity at x = 0.02 is attributed to the disorder-to-order transition, leading to the marked rise in PF.",

    "summary": "Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIAPs) have emerged as powerful tools for accelerating materials simulations with near-density functional theory (DFT) accuracy. However, despite significant advances, we identify a critical yet overlooked issue undermining their reliability: a systematic energy underprediction. This problem becomes starkly evident in large-scale thermodynamic stability assessments. By performing over 12 million calculations using nine MLIAPs for over 150,000 inorganic crystals in the Materials Project, we demonstrate that most frontier models consistently underpredict energy above hull (Ehull), a key metric for thermodynamic stability, total energy, and formation energy, despite the fact that over 90\\% of test structures (DFT-relaxed) are in the training data. The mean absolute errors (MAE) for Ehull exceed ~30 meV/atom even by the best model, directly challenging claims of achieving ``DFT accuracy'' for property predictions central to materials discovery, especially related to (meta-)stability. Crucially, we trace this underprediction to insufficient handling of symmetry degrees of freedom (DOF), constituting both lattice symmetry and Wyckoff site symmetries for the space group. MLIAPs exhibit pronounced errors (MAE for Ehull $>$ ~40 meV/atom) in structures with high symmetry DOF, where subtle atomic displacements significantly impact energy landscapes. Further analysis also indicates that the MLIAPs show severe energy underprediction for a large proportion of near-hull materials. We argue for improvements on symmetry-aware models such as explicit DOF encoding or symmetry-regularized loss functions, and more robust MLIAPs for predicting crystal properties where the preservation and breaking of symmetry are pivotal.",

    "summary": "Electronic systems with quadratic band touchings, commonly found in two- and three-dimensional materials such as Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, kagome metals, HgTe, and pyrochlore iridates, have attracted significant interest concerning the role of interactions in shaping their electronic properties. However, even in the simplest model of spinless fermions on a two-dimensional checkerboard lattice, the quantum phase diagram as a function of nearest-neighbor interaction remains under debate. We employ constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo simulations (CP-QMC) simulations to investigate the problem using a two-dimensional torus geometry. We cross-validate our results on small lattices by comparing them with density-matrix renormalization group calculations, finding quantitative agreement. In particular, we implement an improved optimization scheme within the CP-QMC simulations, enabling the identification of a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal phase that was found in tensor-network studies on cylindrical geometries, but remains inaccessible to Hartree-Fock mean-field methods. The CP-QMC approach makes it possible to establish the emergence of this phase in a geometry that preserves lattice rotational symmetry and permits extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Our results show that the quantum phase diagram of spinless fermions on the checkerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion features three interaction-induced phases at half filling: a quantum anomalous Hall insulator at weak coupling, a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal at intermediate coupling, and a site-nematic insulator at strong coupling.",

    "summary": "Nano-acoustic strain generation in thin metallic films via ultrafast laser excitation is widely used in material science, imaging and medical applications. Recently, it was shown that transition metals, such as Titanium, exhibit enhanced photoacoustic transduction properties compared to noble metals, such as Silver. This work presents experimental results and simulations that demonstrate that among transition metals Tantalum exhibits superior photoacoustic properties. Experiments of nano-acoustic strain generation by femtosecond laser pulses focused on thin Tantalum films deposited on Silicon substrates are presented. The nano-acoustic strains are measured via pump-probe transient reflectivity that captures the Brillouin oscillations produced by photon-phonon interactions. The observed Brillouin oscillations are correlated to the photoacoustic transduction efficiency of the Tantalum thin film and compared to the performance of Titanium thin films, clearly demonstrating the superior photoacoustic transduction efficiency of Tantalum. The findings are supported by computational results on the laser-induced strains and their propagation in these thin metal film/substrate systems using a Two-Temperature Model in combination with thermo-mechanical Finite Element Analysis. Finally, the role of the metal transducer-substrate acoustic impedance matching is discussed and the possibility to generate appropriately modulated acoustic pulse trains inside the crystalline substrate structures for the development of crystalline undulators used for {\\gamma}-ray generation is presented.",

While the interference of lattice bosons has been extensively investigated, quantitative studies of the lattice fermion interference remain challenging. Here, we report the observation and quantitative characterization of interference patterns in low-temperature, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard gases. We develop a novel method to extract first-order correlations from interference patterns, which directly reflect the short-range phase coherence of lattice fermions. Mapping the nearest-neighbor correlations as a function of lattice filling and interaction strength, we observe a crossover from a metal to a Mott insulator. Moreover, at half filling, the measured correlations agree well with quantum Monte Carlo calculations and remain finite in the regime of strong repulsion, revealing virtual tunneling processes driven by quantum fluctuations.",

Here, we propose MGT, a multi-view graph transformer framework that synergistically fuses SE3 invariant and SO3 equivariant graph representations, which respectively captures rotation-translation invariance and rotation equivariance in crystal geometries. To strategically incorporate these complementary geometric representations, we employ a lightweight mixture of experts router in MGT to adaptively adjust the weight assigned to SE3 and SO3 embeddings based on the specific target task. Compared with previous state-of-the-art models, MGT reduces the mean absolute error by up to 21% on crystal property prediction tasks through multi-task self-supervised pretraining. Ablation experiments and interpretable investigations confirm the effectiveness of each technique implemented in our framework. Additionally, in transfer learning scenarios including crystal catalyst adsorption energy and hybrid perovskite bandgap prediction, MGT achieves performance improvements of up to 58% over existing baselines, demonstrating domain-agnostic scalability across diverse application domains. As evidenced by the above series of studies, we believe that MGT can serve as useful model for crystal material property prediction, providing a valuable tool for the discovery of novel materials.",

    "summary": "Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents.",

We demonstrate that by using a few thousand shots from a single copy of the ladder simulator it is possible to estimate the bipartite quantum von Neumann entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. The estimation relies on an optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the bitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named Aquila. We discuss the limitations associated with finite sampling, sorting fidelity, adiabatic preparation, ramp-down of the Rabi frequency before measurement, and readout errors. We use cumulative probability distribution to compare Aquila results with high accuracy density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or exact results. The state preparation appears to be the main source of error. We discuss the large volume behavior of the cumulative probability distribution and show examples where for a finite number of shots, there appears to be some large enough size for which any given state is seen at most once with high probability. We show that the results presented can be extended to multipartite entanglement. We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations for large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the near future.",

To study the corresponding complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\\lambda$. Although the variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover, we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state.

In holographic settings, it admits a geometric interpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and RT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a generalization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected multi-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric obstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this quantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and examine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps. We further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to vanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these quantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite structure in holographic quantum systems.",

    "summary": "We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature, $\\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature. Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\\kappa_{xy}/T$ is consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\\Gamma$ and $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we show that positive $\\Gamma$ and negative $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ lead to a remarkable enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\\Gamma$ term go beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation effects, while those of the $\\Gamma^\\prime$ term are well captured at the classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such as $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated materials.",

Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded, retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable, ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.",

With the rapid advancement of quantum technologies, efficient quantum state preparation has become increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel approach for quantum state preparation based on the Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagram (LimTDD). LimTDD combines the advantages of tensor networks and decision diagrams, enabling efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states. Compared with the state-of-the-art quantum state preparation method, LimTDD demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency when dealing with complex quantum states, while also reducing the complexity of quantum circuits. Examples indicate that, in the best-case scenario, our method can achieve exponential efficiency gains over existing methods. This study not only highlights the potential of LimTDD in quantum state preparation but also provides a robust theoretical and practical foundation for the future development of quantum computing technologies.",

We show that in the correlated metallic regime, an accurate description of the conductivity requires not only the correct spectral function but also the inclusion of complex multi-electron processes encoded in vertex corrections. The crossover to the Mott insulating regime is marked by a vanishing contribution of vertex corrections to the DC conductivity. However, in the Mott insulating case, vertex corrections remain significant for the optical conductivity.",

Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that such a system supports the formation of trimers, namely, three-exciton bound states consisting of a single dipole in one layer and two dipoles in the second layer. At sufficiently low temperatures and densities, these trimers condense into a trimer superfluid phase. Increasing the excitonic density induces a quantum phase transition into a phase in which condensates of independent dipoles exist in both layers, in parallel to the trimers. We also study the thermal transitions out of these phases, and find that while the normal state is reached directly from the trimer superfluid, the thermal disordering of the two-superfluid phase involves an intermediate state which is either a trimer superfluid or a single excitonic condensate in the denser layer. A potential experimental realization using transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures is discussed.",

I then shortly review how to use the Bethe ansatz in $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, and then apply such procedure to the D5-D3 system. The dual field theory of such system corresponds to a defected version of $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, where the one-point functions of certain scalars are non-zero. The calculation of one-point functions is mapped to the overlap between matrix product states and Bethe states. The matrix product states are found to be solutions of the twisted Boundary Yang-Baxter equation, and equivalently the representations of extended twisted Yangian. By dressing procedure or coproduct property, we can connect the scalar matrix product state and higher dimension matrix product states. We have used the branching rules to find the connection with some detailed parameters needed to be fixed. Such method can not only be used for calculations of one-point functions in probe-branes system, but also shed some light on non-equilibrium system.",

Using large-scale tensor network and exact diagonalization methods, we determine the topology of the phase diagram, identifying an ``odd'' deconfined phase, confinement- and Higgs-induced valence bond solids (VBS), and a trivial paramagnet. Most notably, we uncover an exotic multicritical point along the self-dual line, where electric and magnetic excitations are related by an enriched $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ duality. This transition is marked by the simultaneous onset of confinement, Higgs condensation, translational symmetry breaking, and spontaneous duality symmetry breaking. Within our numerical accuracy, the transition appears continuous, involving the softening of excitation gaps for $e$ and $m$ anyons at finite momentum. At intermediate couplings, we further identify VBS phases with enlarged unit cells, potentially indicating frustration-induced crystalline order beyond commensurate limits.",

    "summary": "The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.",

We perform simulated randomised benchmarking across squeezing levels between 5 and 15 dB and find strong agreement with analytical estimates for high quality GKP qubits. As a demonstration of practical computation, we simulate a three-qubit Grover's algorithm within the QRL and identify a fundamental squeezing threshold -- approximately 10 dB -- beyond which the algorithm outperforms classical probability bounds.",

As part of the Munich Quantum Valley (MQV) ecosystem, the course fosters interdisciplinary collaboration between technical and business students, equipping them with the skills necessary to contribute to or lead in the emerging quantum industry. The QEL curriculum integrates two complementary tracks. First, technical students form teams where they engage in cutting-edge, industry-relevant research topics under academic supervision. Meanwhile business students in a parallel course explore commercialization strategies, risks, and opportunities within the quantum technology landscape. Midway through the semester, a selection of the business students join the technical course to form interdisciplinary teams which assess the feasibility of transforming scientific concepts into viable business solutions. The course culminates in three key deliverables: a publication-style technical report, a white paper analyzing the business potential and financial requirements, and a startup pitch presented to the quantum community at a Demo Day. This work outlines the course structure, objectives, and outcomes, providing a model for other institutions seeking to cultivate a highly skilled, innovation-driven workforce in quantum science and technology.",

    "summary": "The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is \\emph{localized} for all investigated \\emph{nonzero} temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.",

However, the increasing system scale and data dimensionality introduce significant computational and memory burdens, particularly in large-scale industrial datasets, limiting detection efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes Rec-AD, a computationally efficient framework that integrates Tensor Train decomposition with the Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM). Rec-AD enhances training and inference efficiency through embedding compression, optimized data access via index reordering, and a pipeline training mechanism that reduces memory communication overhead. Fully compatible with PyTorch, Rec-AD can be integrated into existing FDIA detection systems without code modifications. Experimental results show that Rec-AD significantly improves computational throughput and real-time detection performance, narrowing the attack window and increasing attacker cost. These advancements strengthen edge computing capabilities and scalability, providing robust technical support for smart grid security.",

Our work provides a key first step toward solving the inverse scattering problem to extract effective multi-orbital models from information-dense RIXS measurements, which can be applied to a host of quantum materials.

    "summary": "Increasingly large datasets of microscopic images with atomic resolution facilitate the development of machine learning methods to identify and analyze subtle physical phenomena embedded within the images. In this work, microscopic images of honeycomb lattice spin-ice samples serve as datasets from which we automate the calculation of net magnetic moments and directional orientations of spin-ice configurations. In the first stage of our workflow, machine learning models are trained to accurately predict magnetic moments and directions within spin-ice structures. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), an emergent unsupervised deep learning technique, are employed to generate high-quality synthetic magnetic force microscopy (MFM) images and extract latent feature representations, thereby reducing experimental and segmentation errors. The second stage of proposed methodology enables precise identification and prediction of frustrated vertices and nanomagnetic segments, effectively correlating structural and functional aspects of microscopic images. This facilitates the design of optimized spin-ice configurations with controlled frustration patterns, enabling potential on-demand synthesis.",

The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass it is determined that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at large phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. The transition temperature of Bose--Einstein condensates of these pairs is estimated. It is determined that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.",

    "summary": "The GdFeO$_3$-type perovskite antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$, calculated here to be altermagnetic for all three typical collinear antiferromagnetic orders, was suggested early on to be a Slater-type insulator, due in large part to its continuous metal-insulator transition and its small energy gap. Below the N\\'eel temperature, the gap opens along with ``weak magnetism'', accompanied by a discontinuity in the magnetic susceptibility. Most other properties remain continuous. Without explicit correlation in the band structure calculation, and neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC), already a gap opens. Inclusion of a modest on-site Coulomb repulsion ($U\\sim$ 1 eV) is sufficient to eliminate a SOC-induced small band overlap, reproducing the experimentally observed gap of several tens meV as reported earlier. This evidence supports the viewpoint that NaOsO$_3$ lies in an unusual crossover region between Slater and Mott insulator. The unreported altermagnetism in NaOsO$_3$ is demonstrated and its consequences are considered. The origin of the very weak magnetism has been investigated using a combination of {\\it ab initio} calculations and symmetry analysis of the magnetic space group, confirming the origin lying in the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya spin-orbit coupling buttressed by altermagnetic order. After determining the easy axis, our calculation leads to an Os spin canting angle of about 3$^{\\circ}$, accounting for the observed weak magnetism and the resulting discontinuity in the susceptibility. The altermagnetism spin-split bands (up to $\\sim$100 meV) result in a chiral-split magnon spectrum in both acoustic and optical modes in the THz range, and lead to significant anomalous Hall conductivity upon hole doping.",

    "summary": "Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.",

    "summary": "Wide bandgap semiconductors with high room temperature mobilities are promising materials for high-power electronics. Stannate films provide wide bandgaps and optical transparency, although electron-phonon scattering can limit mobilities. In SrSnO3, epitaxial strain engineering stabilizes a high-mobility tetragonal phase at room temperature, resulting in a threefold increase in electron mobility among doped films. However, strain relaxation in thicker films leads to nanotextured coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases with unclear implications for optoelectronic performance. The observed nanoscale phase coexistence demands nano-spectroscopy to supply spatial resolution beyond conventional, diffraction-limited microscopy. With nano-infrared spectroscopy, we provide a comprehensive analysis of phase coexistence in SrSnO3 over a broad energy range, distinguishing inhomogeneous phonon and plasma responses arising from structural and electronic domains. We establish Nanoscale Imaging and Spectroscopy with Machine-learning Assistance (NISMA) to map nanotextured phases and quantify their distinct optical responses through a robust quantitative analysis, which can be applied to a broad array of complex oxide materials.",

    "summary": "The development of new experimental techniques for direct measurement of many-body correlations is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of strongly correlated electron systems. In this work, we propose a coincidence double-tip scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) that enables direct probing of spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations of sample electrons. Unlike conventional single-tip scanning tunneling microscopy, the double-tip STS employs a double-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM) equipped with two independently controlled tips, each biased at distinct voltages ($V_1$ and $V_2$). By simultaneously measuring the quantum tunneling currents $I_1(t)$ and $I_2(t)$ at locations $j_1$ and $j_2$, we obtain a coincidence tunneling current correlation $\\overline{\\langle I_1(t) I_2(t)\\rangle}$. Differentiating this coincidence tunneling current correlation with respect to the two bias voltages yields a coincidence dynamical conductance. Through the development of a nonequilibrium theory, we demonstrate that this coincidence dynamical conductance is proportional to a contour-ordered second-order current correlation function. For the sample electrons in a nearly free Fermi liquid state, the coincidence dynamical conductance captures two correlated dynamical electron propagation processes: (i) from $j_1$ to $j_2$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_1$, and (ii) from $j_2$ to $j_1$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_2$. For the sample electrons in a superconducting state, additional propagation channels emerge from the superconducting condensate, coexisting with the above normal electron propagation processes. Thus, the coincidence double-tip STS provides direct access to spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations, offering a powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated electron systems.",

Density-functional-theory calculations locate the lowest-energy Pr superlattices for both Ba- and Y-site substitution. In the Ba-site case, the smaller Pr ion pulls the surrounding atoms inward. This breathing-mode distortion pins charge-stripe walls to the Pr columns and forces them to align along the $c$ axis. Y-site Pr is larger than the host ion, produces an outward distortion, and fails to pin the stripes. Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo simulations show that the stripe correlation length rises in step with the structural correlation length of the Pr dopant as observed in prior experiments. We thus identify dopant-induced lattice pinning as the key mechanism behind 3D charge order in Pr-doped YBCO7. This approach provides quantitative guidelines for engineering electronic orders through targeted ionic substitution.",

To accurately model UC at reactor operating conditions, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using an active learning procedure to generate a comprehensive training dataset capturing diverse atomic configurations. The resulting MLIP predicts structural, elastic, thermophysical properties, defect formation energies, and diffusion behaviors, aligning well with experimental and theoretical benchmarks. This work significantly advances computational methods to explore UC, enabling efficient large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations essential for reactor fuel qualification.",

    "summary": "Twisted magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a promising route for multiferroic engineering, yet modeling large-scale moir\\'e superlattices remains challenging. Leveraging a newly developed SpinGNN++ framework that effectively handles spin-lattice coupled systems, we develop a comprehensive interatomic machine learning (ML) potential and apply it to twisted bilayer NiI2 (TBN). Structural relaxation introduces moir\\'e-periodic \"bumps\" that modulate the interlayer spacing by about 0.55~\\AA{} and in-plane ionic shifts up to 0.48~\\AA{}. Concurrently, our ML potential, which faithfully captures all key spin interactions, produces reliable magnetic configurations; combined with the generalized KNB mechanism, it yields accurate spin-driven polarization. For twist angles 1.89^{\\circ} \\leq \\theta \\leq 2.45^{\\circ}, both mechanisms become prominent, yielding rich polarization textures that combine ionic out-of-plane dipoles with purely electronic in-plane domains. In the rigid (unrelaxed) bilayer, skyrmions are absent; lattice relaxation is essential for generating polar-magnetic topologies. In contrast, near {\\theta} \\approx 60^{\\circ}, stacking-dependent ferroelectric displacements dominate, giving rise to polar meron-antimeron networks. These results reveal cooperative ionic and spin-driven ferroelectricity in TBN, positioning twisted vdW magnets as adaptable platforms for tunable multiferroic devices.",

By jointly optimizing the three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies.

    "summary": "The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped SmNiO$_2$, exhibiting the record-high transition temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer (IL) nickelates, has opened a new avenue for exploring design principles of superconductivity. Experimentally determining the electronic structure and magnetic interactions in this new system is crucial to elucidating the mechanism behind the enhanced superconductivity. Here, we report a Ni $L$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of superconducting Sm-based IL nickelate thin films Sm$_{1-x-y-z}$Eu$_x$Ca$_y$Sr$_z$NiO$_2$ (SECS). Dispersive paramagnonic excitations are observed in both optimally and overdoped SECS samples, supporting a spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenario. However, despite the two-fold enhancement of $T_c$ in the Sm-based nickelates compared to their Pr-based counterparts, the effective exchange coupling strength is reduced by approximately $20\\%$. This behavior contrasts with hole-doped cuprates, where magnetic interactions correlate positively with $T_c$, highlighting essential differences in their superconducting mechanisms.",

When applied out-of-sample, further data collection for improvement of the uMLIPs may, however, be required. In this work we demonstrate that, whenever the envisaged use of the MLIPs is global optimization, the data acquisition can follow an active learning scheme in which a gradually updated uMLIP directs the finding of new structures, which are subsequently evaluated at the density functional theory (DFT) level. In the scheme, we augment foundation models using a {\\Delta}-model based on this new data using local SOAP-descriptors, Gaussian kernels, and a sparse Gaussian Process Regression model. We compare the efficacy of the approach with different global optimization algorithms, Random Structure Search, Basin Hopping, a Bayesian approach with competitive candidates (GOFEE), and a replica exchange formulation (REX). We further compare several foundation models, CHGNet, MACE-MP0, and MACE-MPA. The test systems are silver-sulfur clusters and sulfur-induced surface reconstructions on Ag(111) and Ag(100). Judged by the fidelity of identifying global minima, active learning with GPR-based {\\Delta}-models appears to be a robust approach. Judged by the total CPU time spent, the REX approach stands out as being the most efficient.",

It is critical to the execution of many quantum algorithms, including those in quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose a family of efficient QSP algorithms tailored to different numbers of available ancilla qubits - ranging from no ancilla qubits, to a single ancilla qubit, to a sufficiently large number of ancilla qubits. Our algorithms are based on a novel decision diagram that is fundamentally different from the approaches used in previous QSP algorithms. Specifically, our approach exploits the power of Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagrams (LimTDDs) - a highly compact representation of quantum states that combines tensor networks and decision diagrams to reduce quantum circuit complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches and exhibit better scalability for large-scale quantum states, both in terms of runtime and gate complexity. Furthermore, our method shows exponential improvement in best-case scenarios. This paper is an extended version of [1], with three more algorithms proposed.",

    "summary": "Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ans\\\"atze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Using the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.",

    "summary": "We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830 T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable parameters of the original model.

We identify low-entanglement time slices of the scattering dynamics and exploit their efficient representation by tensor networks.

    "summary": "Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at https://h-bn.info, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.",

    "summary": "Altermagnets present a new class of fully compensated collinear magnetic order, where the two sublattices are not related merely by time-reversal combined with lattice translation or inversion, but require an additional lattice rotation. This distinctive symmetry leads to a characteristic splitting of the magnon bands; however the splitting is only partial -- residual degeneracies persist along certain lines in the Brillouin zone as a consequence of the underlying altermagnetic rotation. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic spin model on the checkerboard lattice and introduce additional interactions such as an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, that lift these degeneracies. The resulting magnon bands become fully gapped and acquire non-trivial topology, characterized by nonzero Chern numbers. We demonstrate the crucial role of altermagnetism for the generation of the Berry curvature. As a direct consequence of the topological magnons, we find finite thermal Hall conductivity $\\kappa_{xy}$, which exhibits a characteristic low-temperature scaling, $\\kappa_{xy}\\propto T^4$. Moreover, $\\kappa_{xy}$ changes sign under reversal of the magnetic field, exhibiting a sharp jump across zero field at low temperatures. We also demonstrate topologically protected chiral edge modes in a finite strip geometry.",

The hybrid improper ferroelectric Pc phase transitions to a competing P21 phase with purely in plane polarization upon switching, accompanied by a 90 degree rotation of weak ferromagnetism. Crucially, the Pc phase exhibits altermagnetism, while P21 displays full Brillouin zone band splitting, with persistent spin textures rotating 90 degree at the phase boundary.

We compare the resulting energetics of these electronic phases for the electron dispersion relation $E_k = c_2 k^2+c_4 k^4$. Motivated by the recent discovery of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene systems, we apply our analysis to relevant parameter regimes. We demonstrate that topological chiral superconducting phases (including a spin-unpolarized state) can be energetically favored over the spin-valley polarized Fermi liquid above the density of Wigner crystal phase. Our results show that the preference for chiral superconductivity is strongest when $c_2$ lies between zero and a negative value, corresponding to a system on the verge of forming a hole pocket around $k=0$. This finding suggests that superconductivity can arise from pure repulsive Coulomb interactions in systems with an almost flat band bottom, without relying on the pairing instability of a Fermi surface. This mechanism opens a new pathway to superconductivity beyond the conventional BCS mechanism.",

    "summary": "Accurately calculating band gaps for given crystal structures is highly desirable. However, conventional first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) within the local density approximation (LDA) fail to predict band gaps accurately. To address this issue, the quasi-particle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method is often employed as it is one of the most reliable theoretical approaches for predicting band gaps. Despite its accuracy, QSGW requires significant computational resources. To overcome this limitation, we propose combining QSGW with machine learning. In this study, we applied QSGW to 1,516 materials from the Materials Project [https://materialsproject.org/] and used machine learning to predict QSGW band gaps as a function of the partial density of states (PDOS) in LDA. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms linear regression approaches with linearly-independent descriptor generation [https://github.com/Hitoshi-FUJII/LIDG]. This model is a prototype for predicting material properties based on PDOS.",

    "summary": "Significant research advances have led to a consensus that the Fermi-Hubbard model and its extended variants are archetypal frameworks for elucidating the intertwined relationship between stripe orders and superconductivity in hole-doped high-$T_c$ materials. Notably, the Hubbard quantum simulator has recently achieved several remarkable breakthroughs, e.g., being successfully cooled down to the cryogenic regime and enabling the observation of stable fluctuating stripes. However, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing of electrons in the presence of stripes at low temperatures remains poorly understood due to the intricate interplay among the strongly correlated effects and non-negligible thermal fluctuations. Here, we conduct a close investigation of a partially-filled stripe in the representative $t$-$J$ and Fermi-Hubbard models with both numerical and analytical methods. Analogous to quantum gas microscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the high-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the ground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data demonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously pair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Then, using the effective theory of quantum colored string, we reconstruct the wavefunction and determine the nature of spinon pairing and its connection to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Furthermore, spinon singlet pairs enable the establishment of a long-range pair-pair correlation between double stripes. Our work offers new insights into the role of stripe orders in mediating $d$-wave superconductivity and paves the way for further exploration of multi-stripe-mediated pairing mechanisms in the Fermi-Hubbard model.",

    "summary": "Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization, placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes: deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom. Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape fractionalization and confinement.",

    "summary": "Neural network quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for addressing quantum many-body problems. While successful for model Hamiltonians, their application to molecular systems remains challenging for several reasons. In this work, we introduce three innovations to overcome some of the key limitations. (1) We propose two novel ans\\\"atzet hat hybridize tensor network and neural network states for addressing initialization challenges and enhancing the expressivity of tensor networks. First, we develop a bounded-degree graph recurrent neural network (BDG-RNN) ansatz that leverages graph-based updates, enabling applications to molecular electronic structure problems. Second, we introduce restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) inspired correlators to further enhance expressivity and improve accuracy, without dramatically modifying the underlying variational Monte Carlo (VMC) optimization framework. (2) We introduce a semi-stochastic algorithm for local energy evaluation, which significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. Combining these advances, we demonstrate that our approaches can achieve chemical accuracy in challenging systems, including the one-dimensional hydrogen chain H50, the iron-sulfur cluster [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]^{2-}, and a three-dimensional $3 \\times 3 \\times 2$ hydrogen cluster H18. These methods are implemented in an open-source package - PyNQS (https://github.com/Quantum-Chemistry-Group-BNU/PyNQS) to advance NQS methodologies for quantum chemistry.",

The MLIP was trained on density functional theory (DFT) data and validated against various quantities including energies, forces, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, and defect formation energies, achieving excellent agreement with DFT calculations, prior experimental results and our thermal conductivity measurement. The potential was then employed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict key thermal properties such as melting point, thermal expansion, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. To further assess model accuracy, we fabricated a UN sample and performed new thermal conductivity measurements representative of single-crystal properties, which show strong agreement with the MLIP predictions. This work confirms the reliability and predictive capability of the developed potential for determining the thermal properties of UN.",

    "summary": "Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.",

    "summary": "Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become the gold standard for atomistic simulations, yet their extension to magnetic materials remains challenging because spin fluctuations must be captured either explicitly or implicitly. We address this problem for the technologically vital Fe-Cr-C system by constructing two deep machine learning potentials in DeePMD realization: one trained on non-magnetic DFT data (DP-NM) and one on spin-polarised DFT data (DP-M). Extensive validation against experiments reveals a striking dichotomy. The dynamic, collective properties, viscosity and melting temperatures are reproduced accurately by DP-NM but are incorrectly estimated by DP-M. Static, local properties, density, and lattice parameters are captured excellently by DP-M, especially in Fe-rich alloys, whereas DP-NM fails. This behaviour is explained by general properties of paramagnetic state: at high temperature, local magnetic moments self-average in space and time, so their explicit treatment is unnecessary for transport properties but essential for equilibrium volumes. Exploiting this insight, we show that a transfer-learning protocol, pre-training on non-magnetic DFT and fine-tuning on a small set of spin-polarised data, reduces the computational cost to develop magnetic MLIPs by more than an order of magnitude. Developing general-purpose potentials that capture static and dynamic behaviors throughout the whole composition space requires proper accounting for temperature-induced spin fluctuations in DFT calculations and correctly incorporating spin degrees of freedom into classical force fields.",

While extensively studied in non-interacting systems, the interplay between NHSE and strong electron correlations remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the non-Hermitian Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping, employing real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT), a novel extension to such non-Hermitian correlated models-to capture both local correlations and spatial inhomogeneities. By analyzing the end-to-end Green's function as probes of directional amplification, we demonstrate that strong correlations can suppress the skin effect, leading to a crossover from boundary-dominated to correlation-driven dynamics. Our systematic study reveals that correlations dominate at small to intermediate strength of asymmetric hopping, inducing exponential decay in the end-to-end Green's function, but higher strength of asymmetric hopping can restore amplification even at strong interaction. These results illuminate the tunable interplay between correlations and non-Hermitian physics, suggesting avenues for engineering non-reciprocal transport in correlated open quantum systems.",

Our approach employs two distinct machine-learning frameworks: a machine-learned force field to generate molecular dynamics trajectories and a second model for electric field gradients that preserves rotational and translational symmetries. By incorporating thermostat-driven molecular dynamics sampling, we enable the prediction of quadrupolar coupling constants in highly disordered materials at finite temperatures. We validate our method by predicting the tetragonal-to-cubic phase transition temperature of the organic-inorganic halide perovskite MAPbI$_3$, obtaining results that closely match experimental data.",

This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.",

The tr-RIXS spectra reveal distinctive features, including two-kink continua at high energies and oscillatory spectral weight at low energies, both strongly influenced by the pump dynamics. By systematically analyzing the nonequilibrium tr-RIXS cross section under various pump configurations, we demonstrate how the spectra encode detailed information about the system's transient states, capturing instantaneous Hamiltonian parameters and the traversal of equilibrium quantum critical points during dynamic evolution. Notably, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between oscillatory features in the low-energy spectra and dynamical quantum phase transitions, offering a novel and experimentally accessible approach for their detection. These findings highlight the versatility of tr-RIXS as a powerful tool for studying quantum systems far from equilibrium and their critical phenomena.",

However, precise experimental adsorption energies are scarce due to the complexity of experiments, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain computationally expensive for large-scale material screening. Machine learning models trained on DFT data have emerged as a promising alternative, but face challenges such as functional dependency, limited labeled high-fidelity data, and interpretability issues. Herein, we present DOS Transformer for Adsorption (DOTA), a novel deep learning model that leverages local density of states (LDOS) as input to predict chemically accurate adsorption energies across metallic and intermetallic surfaces. DOTA integrates multi-head self-attention mechanisms with LDOS feature engineering to capture orbital interaction patterns, achieving superior accuracy and transferability. Pretrained on PBE-level DFT data, DOTA can be fine-tuned using minimal high-fidelity experimental or hybrid functional data to predict adsorption energies with chemical accuracy. The model resolves long-standing challenges, such as the \"CO puzzle\" and outperforms traditional theories, like the d-band center and Fermi softness models. It provides a robust framework for efficient catalyst and electrode screening, bridging the gap between computational and experimental approaches.",

We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2 error of $1.94 \\times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and \\(15-500\\times\\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery: exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical methods.",

However, because energy dissipation is typically introduced phenomenologically, its validity for describing nonequilibrium processes and long-time dynamics in real materials remains questionable. In this paper, we derive a generalized stochastic LLG equation from first principles for spin-orbital coupled Mott insulators, explicitly incorporating the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and lattice vibrations. Our approach is based on the path-integral formalism formulated along the Keldysh contour, which naturally accounts for dissipation and thermal fluctuations through interactions with a phonon bath and emergent stochastic noise. We benchmark our theoretical framework by numerically integrating the equations of motion for a two-orbital spin chain coupled to Einstein phonons. The resulting energy relaxation mimics realistic cooling dynamics, exhibits nontrivial transient behavior during thermalization, and accurately reproduces thermodynamic properties upon equilibration. This demonstrates the robustness and reliability of our formalism for capturing both equilibrium and nonequilibrium aspects of dissipative spin dynamics in strongly correlated systems. We further show how electron-phonon coupling induces hybridization between electronic and phononic modes in the excitation spectrum. Finally, we demonstrate how the conventional LLG equations can be recovered as a limiting case of our microscopic theory, and discuss their applicability to real materials.",

Here, we report that superconductivity occurs in a uniform and fully ordered N${\\'e}$el state in a single-layer cuprate La$_2$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$ with a small amount of excess oxygen $(\\delta = 0.015)$ as demonstrated by the $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance measurement. A uniform oxygen distribution in the crystal is crucial for achieving microscopic phase coexistence and overcoming the miscibility gap associated with the staging instability; self-organized periodic oxygen arrangement driven by mobile oxygen atoms. This finding prompts the reconsideration of superconductivity in cuprates, highlighting that it can emerge in a robust N${\\'e}$el state that retains sizable magnetic moments and hosts only a small carrier density.",

We also report unique electronic behaviour, including amplification of the electronic band-gap with tensile strain, and insulating, charge-ordered phases with non-orthorhombic tilt patterns. To provide clarity to the trends we observe, we also investigate the coupling between the breathing mode and strain, where we observe certain strains to directly favour and disfavour the creation of the breathing mode (and thus the associated charge-ordering). The amplification of the band gap with strain is understood in terms of a cooperative coupling between the elastic constraint and octahedral breathing, which expands on the previously reported triggered mechanism mediated by octahedral tilting.",

    "summary": "Valley polarization and altermagnetism are two emerging fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics, offering unprecedented opportunites for information encoding and processing in novel energy-efficient devices. By coupling valley and spin degrees of freedom with ferroic orders such as ferroelectricity, nonvolatile memory functionalities can be achieved. Here, we propose a way to realize ferroelectric-valley (FE-valley) and FE-altermagnetic coupling in a bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) honeycomb lattices based on an effective four-band spin-full $k\\cdot p$ model. Our proposal is validated in bilayer MnPTe$_3$ through first-principles calculations. A spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization occurs in AB- (BA-) stacking configuration, which is reversibly switchable via interlayer sliding. Remarkably, polarization reversal simultaneously inverts both layer-resolved valley polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. This dual control enables tunable layer-spin-locked anomalous valley Hall effects and an unprecedented magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets. Our work establishes a general paradigm for electrically programmable valleytronic and spintronic functionalities of 2D AFM materials.",

    "summary": "The performance of carbon nanotube (CNT) cables, a contender for copper-wire replacement, is tied to its metallic and semi-conducting-like conductivity responses with temperature; the origin of the semi-conducting-like response however is an underappreciated incongruity in literature. With controlled aspect-ratio and doping-degree, over 61 unique cryogenic experiments including anisotropy and Hall measurements, CNT cable performance is explored at extreme temperatures (65 mK) and magnetic fields (60 T). A semi-conducting-like conductivity response with temperature becomes temperature-independent approaching absolute-zero, uniquely demonstrating the necessity of heterogeneous fluctuation induced tunneling; complete de-doping leads to localized hopping, contrasting graphite's pure metallic-like response. High-field magneto-resistance (including +22% longitudinal magneto-resistance near room-temperature) is analyzed with hopping and classical two-band models, both similarly yielding a parameter useful for conductor development. Varying field-orientation angle uncovers two-and four-fold symmetries from Aharonov-Bohm-like corrections to curvature-induced bandgap. Tight-binding calculations using Green's Function formalism model large-scale, coherent transport in commensurate CNT bundles in magnetic field, revealing non-uniform transmission across bundle cross-sections with doping restoring uniformity; independent of doping, transport in bundle-junction-bundle systems are predominantly from CNTs adjacent to the other bundle. The final impact is predicting the ultimate conductivity of heterogeneous CNT cables using temperature and field-dependent transport, surpassing conductivity of traditional metals.",

The valley photovoltaic concept is a novel implementation of a hot-carrier solar cell and leverages the valley scattering effect under large electric field to potentially achieve high voltage and high efficiency. Fabricated devices have shown S-shaped current-voltage curves, low fill factor, and thus low efficiency. We hence develop the first device model for valley photovoltaics. Our model includes electric-field-dependent valley scattering rates extracted from previous ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the condition of nonequilibrium carrier populations in the satellite valleys is not enough for valley photovoltaics to achieve high efficiency. We also show that increasing the built-in electric field of the valley-scattering region does not improve efficiency, contrary to previous suggestion.",

We consider a two-leg ladder lattice coupled to Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions and verify the results of the VQE simulations using tensor network methods. We find that for varying Hamiltonian parameter regimes and in the presence of external charges, the VQE is able to arrive at the gauge-invariant ground state without explicitly enforcing gauge invariance through penalty terms. Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are performed on IBM's quantum platform. Thus, VQEs are seen to be a promising tool for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs, and could pave the way for studies of other gauge groups. We find that the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is favorable for avoiding barren plateaus. At the same time, it is not clear how to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore, strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.",

At half-filling and for interaction strengths and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence, carried out dynamical vertex approximation (D$\\Gamma$A) simulations which allow for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the local ones of DMFT. Our numerical data show that close to half-filling the large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain doping value, charge fluctuations eventually become larger in D$\\Gamma$A with respect to DMFT indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime. This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the D$\\Gamma$A kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute value of the) D$\\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT.",

We uncover a universal relationship between bipartite entanglement entropy and particle number after the barrier in a one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard system with an external asymmetric potential. Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks - a novel machine learning architecture - we learn this relationship across a broad range of interaction strengths with near-perfect predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a simple analytical binary-entropy-like expression that quantitatively captures the observed correlation for fixed parameters. Our findings open new avenues for characterizing quantum correlations in transport phenomena and provide a powerful framework for predicting entanglement evolution in quantum systems.",

    "summary": "A diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of many-body perturbation theory was recently introduced [J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2025, 16, 3047]. This framework allows us to extend single-reference (SR) Green's function methods defined at the diagrammatic level naturally into multi-reference case, as previously exemplified by the formulation of multi-reference direct random phase approximation (MR-dRPA) and the multi-reference second-order screened exchange approximation (MR-SOSEX). In this work, we further elaborate this framework and use it to develop MR generalizations of two other RPA variants, namely, particle-hole (ph) RPA with exchange (MR-RPAx) and particle-particle RPA (MR-ppRPA). We define these two MR generalizations by infinite order resummations of the generalized `ring' and `ladder' diagrams with antisymmetrized interaction vertices, respectively, which incorporate the contributions from the active-space connected two-body Green's functions. As for MR-dRPA, we derive unified sets of equations that hold at both SR and MR levels for RPAx and ppRPA, respectively. We perform numerical studies of prototypical systems using the three MR-RPA methods and carry out a perturbative analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their behaviors. We find that error cancellation between the second and third orders is a key factor for both SR-RPA and MR-RPA. In addition, we observe that MR-phRPA (MR-dRPA and MR-RPAx) and MR-ppRPA tend to overestimate and underestimate correlation energies, respectively, suggesting that a better accuracy can be achieved by further combining these two channels in the future.",

Recently, tensor network decompositions have emerged as powerful tools for tackling such equations by reducing memory usage and computational complexity. In this paper, we solve for equilibrium density and density-density correlation functions of liquids in confined heterogeneous environments using tensor network methods. We demonstrate that these functions admit high compression when their lengthscale dependence is encoded via quantized tensor trains or when their spatial-coordinate dependence is represented in standard tensor-train format, but not with respect to their dependence on distinct particle coordinates.",

With it, machine learning models were trained on 1,014 Mo-Re-W structures to enable a large compilation of elastic and thermal properties over the complete Mo-Re-W compositional domain with extreme resolution. A series of heat maps spanning the full compositional domain were generated to visually present the impact of alloy constituents on the alloy properties. Our findings identified a balanced (Mo,W) + Re blend as a promising composition for high temperature applications, attributed to a strong and stable (Mo,W) matrix with high Re content and the formation of strengthening (W,Re) precipitates that enhanced mechanical performance at 1600oC. Several Mo-Re-W compositions were manufactured to experimentally validate the computational predictions. This approach provides an efficient and system-agnostic pathway for designing and optimizing alloys for high-temperature applications.",

    "summary": "Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960. Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.

It can be estimated in a large compositional space from pair wise interactions between elements, for which machine learning has recently provided the most accurate predictions. Further improvements requires acquiring high quality data in liquids where models are poorly constrained. In this study, we propose an active learning approach to identify in which liquids additional data are most needed to improve an initial dataset that covers over 400 binary liquids. We identify a critical need for new data on liquids containing refractory elements, which we address by performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for 29 equimolar alloys of Ir, Os, Re and W. This enables more accurate predictions of the enthalpy of mixing, and we discuss the trends obtained for refractory elements of period 6. We use clustering analysis to interpret the results of active learning and to explore how our features can be linked to Miedema's semi empirical theory.",

    "summary": "Atomistic simulations of multi-component systems require accurate descriptions of interatomic interactions to resolve details in the energy of competing phases. A particularly challenging case are topologically close-packed (TCP) phases with close energetic competition of numerous different site occupations even in binary systems like Fe-Mo. In this work, machine learning (ML) models are presented that overcome this challenge by using features with domain knowledge of chemistry and crystallography. The resulting data-efficient ML models need only a small set of training data of simple TCP phases $A$15, $\\sigma$, $\\chi$, $\\mu$, $C$14, $C$15, $C$36 with 2-5 WS to reach robust and accurate predictions for the complex TCP phases $R$, $M$, $P$, $\\delta$ with 11-14 WS. Several ML models with kernel-ridge regression, multi-layer perceptrons, and random forests, are trained on less than 300 DFT calculations for the simple TCP phases in Fe-Mo. The performance of these ML models is shown to improve systematically with increased utilization of domain knowledge. The convex hulls of the $R$, $M$, $P$ and $\\delta$ phase in the Fe-Mo system are predicted with uncertainties of 20-25 meV/atom and show very good agreement with DFT verification. Complementary X-ray diffraction experiments and Rietveld analysis are carried out for an Fe-Mo R-phase sample. The measured WS occupancy is in excellent agreement with the predictions of our ML model using the Bragg Williams approximation at the same temperature.",

Using the Auxiliary master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics. Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.",

Experimentally, this approach is straightforward, except when distinct orderings occur with identical or almost identical symmetry breaking. Here we show that the cuprate system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$ hosts two distinct orderings with almost identical translational symmetry breaking. Only when applying site-sensitive resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), charge ordering can be conclusively differentiated from a super-lattice structure. These two orderings occur with almost the same in-plane symmetry but manifest at different atomic sites and display different temperature dependence. Differentiating these orders provides an important clue to the anomalous behavior of PrBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ within the 123-series of high-temperature superconductors. We conclude that the symmetry breaking at the Pr-site is unfavorable for superconducting pairing.",

This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta, and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific, prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating further temporal evolution.",

Our results show that a sudden quench into a PT-broken phase generally leads to exponential growth in these quantities, driven by the biorthogonal density matrix's non-positivity. In contrast to generic interacting systems, we observe a surprising linear decay in the TTC entropy for non-interacting fermionic systems.

Leveraging this, we construct a Josephson junction setup, where an insulating barrier in the form of a Mott-insulator is sandwiched between two superfluid phases. This is obtained by spatially varying either the statistical phase or the strength of the on-site interaction potential on which the ground state of the system depends. Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can produce the Josephson effect. Furthermore, it is observed that continuous particle flow over time is achievable in this proposed model solely by creating an initial phase difference without any external biasing.",

These lecture notes serve as a detailed guide for implementing the aTTN algorithms. We present a variational algorithm for ground state search and discuss the measurement of observables, and offer an open-source implementation within the Quantum TEA library. We benchmark the performance of the ground state search for different parameters and hyperparameters in the square lattice quantum Ising model and the triangular lattice Heisenberg model for up to $32 \\times 32$ spins.

One possible approach that enables faster computations in four-dimensional lattice theories is the anisotropic tensor renormalization group (ATRG). However, the computational cost remains substantial and requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called the Triad-ATRG, which is based on the ATRG and other improved TRG variants with triad network representation. This method achieves lower scaling with respect to the bond dimension, while minimizing the loss of accuracy in the free energy and other physical quantities. We also present parallel implementations of both the ATRG and Triad-ATRG on multiple GPUs, which significantly improve performance compared to CPU-based calculations for the four-dimensional system.",

    "summary": "This work proposes an efficient numerical approach for compressing a high-dimensional discrete distribution function into a non-negative tensor train (NTT) format. The two settings we consider are variational inference and density estimation, whereby one has access to either the unnormalized analytic formula of the distribution or the samples generated from the distribution. In particular, the compression is done through a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we use existing subroutines to encode the distribution function in a tensor train format. In the second stage, we use an NTT ansatz to fit the obtained tensor train. For the NTT fitting procedure, we use a log barrier term to ensure the positivity of each tensor component, and then utilize a second-order alternating minimization scheme to accelerate convergence. In practice, we observe that the proposed NTT fitting procedure exhibits drastically faster convergence than an alternative multiplicative update method that has been previously proposed. Through challenging numerical experiments, we show that our approach can accurately compress target distribution functions.",

    "summary": "The spin-$1$ orthogonal dimer chain is investigated using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. A transformation to a basis that uses the local eigenstates of the orthogonal dimers, while retaining the local spin states for the parallel spins, allows for more effective implementation of the symmetries, as well as mitigating the entanglement bias of DMRG. A rich ground state phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of inter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration) and an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective Haldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground state wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static properties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and the spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully selected set of representative states is presented. The static properties are complemented by exploring the low-energy dynamics through the calculation of the dynamic structure factor. The results provide crucial insight into the emergence of complex ground state phases from the interplay between strong interactions, geometric frustration, and external magnetic field for interacting S=1 Heisenberg spins.",

    "summary": "In this study, we systematically investigate the thermal and electronic transport properties of two-dimensional PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure by combining first-principles calculations, Boltzmann transport theory, and machine learning methods. The heterostructure exhibits a unique honeycomb-like corrugated and asymmetric configuration, which significantly enhances phonon scattering. Moreover, the relatively weak interatomic interactions in PbSe/PbTe lead to the formation of anti-bonding states, resulting in strong anharmonicity and ultimately yielding ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (${\\kappa_{\\rm L}}$). In the four-phonon scattering model, the ${\\kappa_{\\rm L}}$~values along the $x$ and $y$ directions are as low as 0.37 and 0.31 W/mK, respectively. Contrary to the conventional view that long mean free path acoustic phonons dominate heat transport, we find that optical phonons contribute approximately 59\\% of the lattice thermal conductivity in this heterostructure. These optical phonons exhibit large Gr\\\"uneisen parameters, strong anharmonic scattering, and relatively high group velocities, thereby playing a crucial role in the low ${\\kappa_{\\rm L}}$ regime. Further analysis of thermoelectric performance shows that at a high temperature of 800 K, the heterostructure achieves an exceptional dimensionless figure of merit ($ZT$) of 5.3 along the $y$ direction, indicating outstanding thermoelectric conversion efficiency. These findings not only provide theoretical insights into the transport mechanisms of PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure but also offer a practical design strategy for developing high-performance two-dimensional layered thermoelectric materials.",

Based on a $G$-compatible discretization of the parameter space, we incorporate both group cochains and parameter-space differentials, enabling the systematic construction of equivariant topological invariants. We derive a fixed-point formula for the higher Berry invariant in the case where the symmetry action has isolated fixed points. This reveals that the phase transition point between Haldane and trivial phases acts as a monopole-like defect where higher Berry curvature emanates.

As the size of the systems increases, contracting larger tensor networks becomes computationally demanding. In this work, we study distributed memory architectures intended for high-performance computing implementations to solve this task. Efficiently distributing the contraction task across multiple nodes is critical, as both computational and memory costs are highly sensitive to the chosen partitioning strategy. While prior work has employed general-purpose hypergraph partitioning algorithms, these approaches often overlook the specific structure and cost characteristics of tensor network contractions. We introduce a simulated annealing-based method that iteratively refines the partitioning to minimize the total operation count, thereby reducing time-to-solution. The algorithm is evaluated on MQT Bench circuits and achieves an 8$\\times$ average reduction in computational cost and an 8$\\times$ average reduction in memory cost compared to a naive partitioning.",

However, design of these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials' design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a \\emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules, which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling, depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from fast, coarse simulations.",

This is especially relevant for financial time series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods. We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation method.",

We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation.",

An in-principle exact (in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory, where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density, is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS) lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of such an ansatz to ease convergence and improve substantially the description of density profiles (localized orbital occupations in this context) in strongly correlated systems.",

Yet the lack of reliable, general uncertainty quantification limits their safe, wide-scale use. Here we introduce a unified, scalable uncertainty metric \\(U\\) based on a heterogeneous model ensemble with reuse of pretrained uMLIPs. Across chemically and structurally diverse datasets, \\(U\\) shows a strong correlation with the true prediction errors and provides a robust ranking of configuration-level risk. Leveraging this metric, we propose an uncertainty-aware model distillation framework to produce system-specific potentials: for W, an accuracy comparable to full-DFT training is achieved using only \\(4\\%\\) of the DFT labels; for MoNbTaW, no additional DFT calculations are required. Notably, by filtering numerical label noise, the distilled models can, in some cases, surpass the accuracy of the DFT reference labels. The uncertainty-aware approach offers a practical monitor of uMLIP reliability in deployment, and guides data selection and fine-tuning strategies, thereby advancing the construction and safe use of foundation models and enabling cost-efficient development of accurate, system-specific potentials.",

Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage.",

    "summary": "Understanding how molecules arrange on surfaces is fundamental to surface chemistry and essential for the rational design of catalytic and functional materials. In particular, the energetically most stable configuration provides valuable insight into adsorption-related processes. However, the search for this configuration is a global optimization problem with exponentially growing complexity as the number of adsorbates and possible adsorption sites increases. To address this, we express the adsorption energy as a sum of multi-adsorbate interaction terms, evaluated using our in-house trained machine learning interatomic potential MACE-Osaka24, and formulate the search for the most stable configuration as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem. We employ a tensor-train-based method, Tensor Train Optimizer (TTOpt), to solve the HUBO problem and identify optimal adsorption configurations of CO and NO molecules on various alloys up to full surface coverage. Our results show that including interaction terms up to third order may be sufficient to approximate adsorption energies within chemical accuracy and to identify optimal configurations. We also observed that TTOpt performs better with the HUBO formulation, suggesting that third-order terms help preserve correlations between adsorption sites, which allow TTOpt to optimize configurations more effectively. The extensive benchmarks across various alloys, surface geometries, and adsorbates demonstrate the robustness and applicability of using TTOpt to solve HUBO-type global optimization problems in surface chemistry. In contrast to quantum and digital annealers, which have recently been applied to similar global optimization tasks but are restricted to cost functions with at most quadratic terms, our approach can incorporate higher-order terms in a straightforward manner and does not require specialized hardware.",

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR), a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS, and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising model show that NIR outperforms MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.",

    "summary": "The \"CO adsorption puzzle\", a persistent failure of utilizing generalized gradient approximations (GGA) in density functional theory to replicate CO's experimental preference for top-site adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, remains a critical barrier in surface chemistry. While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The above work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.",

    "summary": "Generalized symmetry extends the usual notion of symmetry to ones that are of higher-form, acting on subsystems, non-invertible, etc. The concept was originally defined in the field theory context using the idea of topological defects. On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is moved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask how to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the unitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit constrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for symmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome, which we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines the symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast, for unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the Cheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full description. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator representations play an important role in our discussion.",

It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.",

Our construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf algebras and to quantum groups. The approach is further applied to the quantum group $U_q[su(2)]$, for which we construct 2D generalizations of its generators, analyze $q$-deformed singlet states, and derive a 2D R-matrix satisfying an intertwining relation in the semiclassical limit. Additionally, we show how tensor network states, particularly PEPS, naturally induce 2D coalgebra structures when supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions. Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical symmetries in quantum many-body physics.",

We find that the local density of states of at each site mirrors that of a homogeneous system with the same local filling.

With the emergence of these exotic point-like particles, it is natural to ask what phases can arise in interacting many-anyon systems. To study this topic, we consider the particular case of Fibonacci anyons subject to an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor repulsion on a two-leg ladder. Focusing on the case of half-filling, for low interaction strengths an ''anyonic'' metal is found, whereas for strong repulsion, the anyons form an insulating charge-density wave. Within the latter regime, we introduce an effective one-dimensional model up to sixth order in perturbation theory arising from anyonic superexchange processes. We numerically identify four distinct phases of the effective model, which we characterize using matrix product state methods. These include both the ferro- and antiferromagnetic golden chain, a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase, and an incommensurate phase.",

We uncover a magnetic-field-induced crossover in the scattering rate: $1/\\tau \\propto B^2$ in the Born regime and $1/\\tau \\propto B^{-2}$ in the unitarity limit. This crossover gives rise to distinct MR behaviors in the EQL, characterized by linear transverse MR ($\\rho_{xx} \\propto B$) and negative longitudinal MR ($\\rho_{zz} \\propto B^{-2}$). This dichotomy implies insulating behavior when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the current, and metallic behavior when it is parallel. In the unitarity limit, we further derive a universal relation that enables direct experimental determination of the impurity density from $\\rho_{xx}$ and $\\rho_{xy}$. Our results establish a quantum--classical correspondence that remains valid even in the EQL, provided that the field dependences of the scattering rate and quantum corrections are properly incorporated.",

The intensity of these excitations reaches a maximum near the midpoint between the center and the boundary of the Brillouin zone, and decreases toward the zone boundary; this behavior contrasts with that of the spin-flip ($\\Delta S = 1$) excitations typically observed via inelastic neutron scattering or Cu $L_3$-edge RIXS. The momentum dependence of the intensity is described by the spin-exchange dynamical structure factor. A phenomenological analysis of the symmetry between the polarization and the $d$ orbital explains the resonance condition for the two-spinon excitations.",

    "summary": "Strong electron correlations drive Mott insulator transitions. Yet, there exists no framework to classify Mott insulators by their degree of correlation. Cuprate superconductors, with their tunable doping and rich phase diagrams, offer a unique platform to investigate the evolution of those interactions. However, spectroscopic access to a clean half-filled Mott-insulating state is lacking in compounds with the highest superconducting onset temperature. To fill this gap, we introduce a pristine, half-filled thallium-based cuprate system, Tl$_2$Ba$_5$Cu$_4$O$_{10+x}$ (Tl2504). Using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), we probe long-lived magnon excitations and uncover a pronounced kink in the magnon dispersion, marked by a simultaneous change in group velocity and lifetime broadening. Modeling the dispersion within a Hubbard-Heisenberg approach, we extract the interaction strength and compare it with other cuprate systems. Our results establish a cuprate universal relation between electron-electron interaction and magnon zone-boundary dispersion. Superconductivity seems to be optimal at intermediate correlation strength, suggesting an optimal balance between localization and itinerancy.",

The 6H perovskites with composition A$_3$BB'$_2$O$_9$ exhibit unique layered structural alternations and typically adopt an antiferromagnetic ground state. Here, we report the discovery that several 6H perovskites are indeed altermagnets exhibiting non-relativistic spin-split bands. We also explore the possible presence of net magnetization due to spin-orbit coupling in these materials, as well as the manifestation of giant piezomagnetism. Since the single crystals of 6H perovskites can be readily grown and cleavable, our findings provide a new avenue to study the cleaved atomically-flat surfaces of altermagnets with advanced experimental techniques such as spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to explore their spin splitting nature.",

    "summary": "Accurately predicting when and how materials fail is critical to designing safe, reliable structures, mechanical systems, and engineered components that operate under stress. Yet, fracture behavior remains difficult to model across the diversity of materials, geometries, and loading conditions in real-world applications. While machine learning (ML) methods show promise, most models are trained on narrow datasets, lack robustness, and struggle to generalize. Meanwhile, physics-based simulators offer high-fidelity predictions but are fragmented across specialized methods and require substantial high-performance computing resources to explore the input space. To address these limitations, we present a data-driven foundation model for fracture prediction, a transformer-based architecture that operates across simulators, a wide range of materials (including plastic-bonded explosives, steel, aluminum, shale, and tungsten), and diverse loading conditions. The model supports both structured and unstructured meshes, combining them with large language model embeddings of textual input decks specifying material properties, boundary conditions, and solver settings. This multimodal input design enables flexible adaptation across simulation scenarios without changes to the model architecture. The trained model can be fine-tuned with minimal data on diverse downstream tasks, including time-to-failure estimation, modeling fracture evolution, and adapting to combined finite-discrete element method simulations. It also generalizes to unseen materials such as titanium and concrete, requiring as few as a single sample, dramatically reducing data needs compared to standard ML. Our results show that fracture prediction can be unified under a single model architecture, offering a scalable, extensible alternative to simulator-specific workflows.",

It mitigates the sign problem while avoiding the ergodicity issues that are intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In this study, we apply the WV-HMC method to the Hubbard model away from half filling, which is known to suffer from a severe sign problem. We compute the number density on lattices of spatial size $6 \\times 6$ and $8 \\times 8$ at inverse temperature $\\beta = 6.4$ using $N_t = 20$ Trotter steps. Our results show that the WV-HMC method remains effective even in parameter regions where non-thimble Monte Carlo methods fail due to severe sign problems. In this work, we employ direct solvers for fermion matrix inversion, with a computational cost of $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom and proportional to the spacetime lattice volume. An alternative algorithm employing pseudofermions and iterative solvers, which reduces the cost to $O(N^2)$ at the expense of careful parameter tuning, will be discussed in a separate publication.",

    "summary": "The electron in a solid can be considered a bound state of the three independent, fundamental degrees of freedom creating quasi-particles: spinons, carrying the electron spin; plasmons carrying the collective charge mode and orbitons carrying its orbital degree of freedom. These fundamental degrees of freedom could form ordering states in which dynamics or collective motions could occurr and manifest as low-energy excitations. The exotic properties that appear in the materials exhibiting these electronic orderings are associated with these low-energy excitations. Although the orbital order (OO) and its coupling to the spin system creates very interesting phenomena, the microscopic origin of OO has been much less explored than other electronic properties as it is very difficult to directly access experimental information from OO. Due to the recent improvement in energy resolution and flux, soft x-ray resonant inelastic scattering (RIXS) allows for a re-examination of orbital excitations in manganites. Here, we present a study of low energy excitations in half doped A-site ordered SmBaMn_{2}O_{6} through a combination of RIXS and soft x-ray resonant elastic scattering (REXS) measurements. The obtained experimental data confirm the OO at \\mathbf{q} = (0.25, 0.25, 0) and find various low energy excitations below 200 meV. while several excitations can be assigned to be of magnetic and phononic origin, a group of excitations between 80 and 200 meV show a temperature dependence distinctively following that of the OO making them possible candidates for orbital excitations.",

    "summary": "We show how to construct Landau-like free energy potentials using a machine-learning approach. For concreteness, we focus on perovskite oxide PbTiO$_{3}$. We work with a training set obtained from Monte Carlo simulations based on an atomistic ''second-principles'' potential for PbTiO$_{3}$. We rely exclusively on data that would be experimentally accessible -- i.e., temperature-dependent polarization and strain, both with and without external electric fields and stresses applied --, to explore scenarios where the training set could be obtained from laboratory measurements. We introduce a scheme that allows us to identify optimal polynomial models of the temperature-dependent free energy surface, mapped as a function of the homogeneous electric polarization and homogeneous strain. Our results for PbTiO$_{3}$ show that a very simple polynomial -- where only two parameters depend linearly on temperature -- is sufficient to yield a correct description of the material's behavior. Remarkably, the obtained models also capture the subtle couplings by which elastic strain controls key features of ferroelectricity in PbTiO$_{3}$ -- i.e., the symmetry of the polar phase and the discontinuous character of the transition --, despite the fact that no effort was made to include such information in the training set. We emphasize the distinctive aspects of our methodology (which relies on an original form of validation step) by comparing it with the usual machine-learning approach for model construction. Our results illustrate how physically motivated models can have remarkable predictive power, even if they are derived from a limited amount of data. We argue that such ''third-principles'' models can be the basis for predictive macroscopic or mesoscopic simulations of ferroelectrics and other materials undergoing non-reconstructive structural transitions.",

Remarkably, electron doping of LaMn2Si2 is predicted to substantially enhance the Hall conductivity, with values reaching up to -650 S/cm.

    "summary": "In multilayered high-Tc cuprates with three or more CuO2 layers per unit cell, the inner CuO2 planes (IPs) are spatially separated from the dopant layers and thus remain cleaner than the outer planes (OPs). While both interlayer coupling and the presence of clean IPs have been proposed as key factors enhancing superconductivity, their individual roles have been difficult to disentangle, as IPs and OPs typically become superconducting simultaneously. Here we investigate five-layer (Cu,C)Ba2Ca4Cu5Oy (Cu1245) with Tc = 78 K and three-layer Ba2Ca2Cu3O6(F,O)2 (F0223) with Tc = 100 K using ARPES, and uncover an unprecedented situation, in which only the IPs become superconducting while the OPs remain metallic at low temperatures. Model calculations indicate that more than 95% of the OP wavefunction remains confined to OP itself, with minimal hybridization from the superconducting IPs. In particular, we experimentally realize an ideal configuration: a single superconducting CuO2 layer sandwiched between heavily overdoped metallic outer layers, which screen disorder originating from the dopant layers. Strikingly, this clean CuO2 layer exhibits the largest superconducting gap among all known cuprates and coherent Bogoliubov peaks extending beyond the antiferromagnetic zone boundary -- long regarded as the boundary beyond which coherence vanishes in heavily underdoped cuprates. Furthermore, a widely extended coherent flat band emerges at the Brillouin zone edge, overcoming the pseudogap damping effect. Our results introduce a new physical parameter, the degree of screening, to investigate the competition between superconductivity and the pseudogap, potentially shedding new light on its origin. The nearly disorder-free superconducting CuO2 layers offer a model platform for bridging the gap between disordered real materials and idealized theoretical models, which generally neglect disorder effects.",

The method exploits the power of anyon condensation in Choi states and is applicable to the cases where the target states arise from pure-state topological phases subject to strong decoherence/disorders in the Abelian sectors. Representative examples include $m^a e^b$ decoherence of $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, decohered non-Abelian $S_3$ quantum double as well as pure $Z$/$X$ decoherence of arbitrary CSS codes. An example of chiral topological phases which cannot arise from local commuting projector models are also presented.",

The goal is to encode classical information directly to the quantum state so that it is possible to leverage quantum algorithms for data processing. However, quantum state preparation of arbitrary states scales exponentially in the number of two-qubit gates, and this makes quantum state preparation a very difficult task on quantum computers, especially on near-term noisy devices. This represents a major challenge in achieving quantum advantage. We present and analyze a novel two-step state preparation method where we first minimize the entanglement entropy of the target quantum state, thus transforming the state to one that is easier to prepare. The state with reduced entanglement entropy is then represented as a matrix product state, resulting in a high accuracy preparation of the target state. Our method is suitable for NISQ devices and we give rigorous lower bounds on the accuracy of the prepared state in terms of the entanglement entropy and demonstrate cutting-edge performance across a collection of benchmark states.",

In this work, we study the training dynamics of Matrix Product State (MPS) classifiers applied to three-class problems, using both fashion MNIST and hyper-spectral satellite imagery as representative datasets. We investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where generalization emerges suddenly after memorization, by tracking entanglement entropy, local magnetization, and model performance across training sweeps. Additionally, we employ information theory tools to gain deeper insights: transfer entropy is used to reveal causal dependencies between label-specific quantum masks, while O-information captures the shift from synergistic to redundant correlations among class outputs. Our results show that grokking in the fashion MNIST task coincides with a sharp entanglement transition and a peak in redundant information, whereas the overfitted hyper-spectral model retains synergistic, disordered behavior. These findings highlight the relevance of high-order information dynamics in quantum-inspired learning and emphasize the distinct learning behaviors that emerge in multi-class classification, offering a principled framework to interpret generalization in quantum machine learning architectures.",

    "summary": "Spin pumping with superconductors has been extensively studied, particularly in double-layer systems. In this study, we investigate spin pumping in a trilayer system comprising a ferromagnetic insulator (FMI), a superconductor (SC), and a normal metal (NM). We derive the AC and DC spin currents in the NM layer induced by spin motion in the FMI under circularly polarized microwave irradiation. If we treat the spin motion as classical, the AC spin current is expressed. On the other hand, if we treat the spin motion as quantum quasiparticles, the DC spin current is derived. After these derivations, while the computational cost of evaluating the spin current is extremely high, we mitigate this using the Quantics Tensor Cross Interpolation (QTCI) method. We present numerical results showing the dependence of the spin current on temperature, microwave frequency, and superconductor layer thickness. Notably, the temperature dependence of AC and DC spin currents exhibits a coherence peak. Furthermore, we have discovered a transition structure in the dependence of the spin current on the thickness of the superconductor layer, where the dependence changes after a particular frequency.",

    "summary": "We introduce a new theoretical framework -- the polarized Houston basis -- to model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.",

    "summary": "The simulation of quantum field theories, both classical and quantum, requires regularization of infinitely many degrees of freedom. However, in the context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$ discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter $N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example, we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different $N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\\textit{field digitization scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension $\\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\\chi$ and $N$. Finally, we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the ground state of a (2+1)D $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum limit of digitized quantum field theories.",
